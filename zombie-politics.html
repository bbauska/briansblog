In a system that reduces life to a chain of disconnected reactions to shock, personal com­

alone and always alone. I-Ie becomes numb and rigid not only in relation to his neighbor but
also in relation to himself; fear robs him of the power of spontaneous emotional or mental

Zombie Politics, Democracy
and the Threat of Authoritarianism

Education is the point at which we decide whether we love the world enough to assume
responsibility for it and by the same token save it from ruin which, except for renewal, except
for the coming of the new and young, would be inevitable. And education, too, is where we
decide whether we love our children enough not to expel them from our world and leave
them to their own devices, nor to strike from their hands their chance of undertaking some­
thing new, something unforeseen by us, but to prepare them in advance for the task of renew­
ing a common world.

HANNAH ARENDT]
THE Rrsrs OF ZoMB|E PoL|r|cs

In the world of popular culture, zombies seem to be everywhere, as evidenced by
the relentless slew of books, movies, video games, and comics. From the haunt­
ing Night qftbe Living Dead to the comic movie Zoméie/and, the figure ofthe zom­
bie has captured and touched something unique in the contemporary imagination.
But the dark and terrifying image of the zombie with missing body parts, oozing
body fluids, and an appetite for fresh, living, human brains does more than feed the
mass-marketing machines that prey on the spectacle of the violent, grotesque, and
ethically comatose. There is more at work in this wave of fascination with the
grotesquely walking hyper-dead than a Hollywood appropriation of the dark
recesses and unrestrained urges of the human mind. The zombie phenomenon is
now on display nightly on television alongside endless examples of destruction
unfolding in real-time. Such a cultural fascination with proliferating images of the
living hyper-dead and unrelenting human catastrophes that extend from a global
economic meltdown to the earthquake in Haiti to the ecological disaster caused by
the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico signals a shift away fiom the hope that accom­
panies the living to a politics of cynicism and despair. The macabre double move­
ment between “the dead that walk”2 and those who are alive but are dying and
suffering cannot be understood outside of the casino capitalism that now shapes
every aspect of society in its own image. A casino capitalist zombie politics views
competition as a form of social combat, celebrates war as an extension of politics,
and legitimates a ruthless Social Darwinism in which particular individuals and
groups are considered simply redundant, disposable-nothing more than human
waste left to stew in their own misfortune-easy prey for the zombies who have a
ravenous appetite for chaos and revel in apocalyptic visions filled with destruction,
decay, abandoned houses, burned-out cars, gutted landscapes, and trashed gas sta­
tions.

The twenty-first-century zombies no longer emerge from the grave; they now
inhabit the rich environs ofWall Street and roam the halls of the gilded monuments
of greed such as Goldman Sachs. As an editorial in The Ne-w York Times points out,
the new zombies of free-market fundamentalism turned “the financial system into
a casino. Like gambling, the transactions mostly just shified paper money around
the globe. Unlike gambling, they packed an enormous capacity for collective and
economic destruction-hobbling banks that made bad bets, freezing credit and eco­
nomic activity Society-not the bankers-bore the cost.”3 In this way the zombie­
the immoral, sub-Nietzschean, id-driven “other” who is “hyper-dead” but still alive
as an avatar of death and cruelty-provides an apt metaphor for a new kind of
authoritarianism that has a grip on contemporary politics in the United States.4 This
is an authoritarianism in which mindless self-gratification becomes the sanctioned
nonn and public issues collapse into the realm of privatized anger and rage. The rule
of the market offers the hyper-dead an opportunity to exercise unprecedented
power in American society, reconstructing civic and political culture almost entire­
ly in the service of a politics that fuels the friend/ enemy divide, even as democra­
cy becomes the scandal of casino capitalism-its ultimate humiliation.

But the new zombies are not only wandering around in the banks, investment
houses, and death chambers of high finance, they have an ever-increasing presence
in the highest reaches of government and in the forefront of mainstream media. The
growing numbers of zombies in the mainstream media have huge iinancial back­
ing from the corporate elite and represent the new face of the culture of cruelty and
hatred in the second Gilded Age. Any mention of the social state, putting limits on
casino capitalism, and regulating corporate zombies puts Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck,
Rush Limbaugh, and other talking heads into a state of high rage. They disparage
any discourse that embraces social justice, social responsibility, and human rights.
Appealing to “real” American values such as family, God, and Guns, they are in the
forefront of a zombie politics that opposes any legislation or policy designed to lessen
human suffering and promote economic and social progress. As Arun Gupta points
out, they are insistent in their opposition to “civil rights, school desegregation,
women’s rights, labor organizing, the minimum wage, Social Security, LGBT
rights, welfare, immigrant rights, public education, reproductive rights, Medicare,
[and] Medicaid.”5 The walking hyper-dead even oppose providing the extension of
unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who are out of work, food, and
hope. They spectacularize hatred and trade in lies and misinformation. They make
populist appeals to the people while legitimating the power of the rich. They appeal
to common sense as a way of devaluing a culture of questioning and critical
exchange. Unrelenting in their role as archetypes of the hyper-dead, they are mis­
anthropes trading in fear, hatred, and hyper-nationalism.

The human suffering produced by the walking hyper-dead can also be seen in
the nativist apoplexy resulting in the racist anti-immigration laws passed in Arizona,
the attempts to ban ethnic studies in public schools, the rise ofthe punishing state,
the social dumping of millions of people of color into prisons, and the attempts of
Tea Party fanatics and politicians who Want to “take back America” from President
Barack Obama-described in the new lexicon of right-wing political illiteracy as
both an alleged socialist and the new Hitler. Newt Gingrich joins Glenn Beck and
other members of the elite squad of the hyper-dead in arguing that Obama is just
another version of _loseph Stalin. For Gingrich and the rest of the zombie ideologues,
any discourse that advocates for social protections, easing human suffering, or
imagining a better future is dismissed by being compared to the horrors ofthe Nazi
holocaust. Dystopian discourse and End Times morbidity rule the collective con­
sciousness of this group.

The “death panels” envisaged by Sarah Palin are not going to emerge from
Obama’s health care reform plan but fiom the toolkits the zombie politicians and
talking heads open up every time they are given the opportunity to speak. The death
threats, vandalism, and crowds shouting homophobic slurs at openly gay U. S.
House Representative Barney Frank already speak to a fixation with images of death,
violence, and war that now grips the country. Sarah Palin’s infamous call to a gath­
ering of her followers to “reload” in opposition to President Obama’s policies-soon
followed in a nationally televised press conference with a request for the American
people to embrace Arizona’s new xenophobic laws-makes her one of the most
prominent ofthe political zombies. Not only has she made less-than-vague endorse­
ments of violence in many of her public speeches, she has cheerfully embraced the
new face of white supremacy in her recent unapologetic endorsement of racial pro­
filing, stating in a widely reported speech that “It’s time for Americans across this
great country to stand up and say, ‘We’re all Arizonians now.’”6 The current descent
into racism, ignorance, corruption, and mob idiocy makes clear the degree to which
politics has become a sport for zombies rather than engaged and thoughtful citi­
zens.7

The hyper-dead celebrate talk radio haters such as Rush Limbaugh, whose
fanaticism appears to pass without criticism in the mainstream media. Limbaugh
echoes the fanatics who whipped up racial hatred in Weimar Germany, the ideo­
logical zombies who dissolved the line between reason and distortion-laden propa­
ganda. I-Iow else to explain his claim “that environmentalist terrorists might have
caused the ecological disaster in the gulf ”?8 The ethically frozen zombies that
dominate screen culture believe that only an appeal to self-interest motivates peo­
ple-a convenient counterpart to a culture of cruelty that rebukes, if not disdains,
any appeal to the virtues of a moral and just society. They smile at their audiences
while collapsing the distinction between opinions and reasoned arguments. They
report on Tea Party rallies while feeding the misplaced ideological frenzy that
motivates such gatherings but then refuse to comment on rallies all over the coun­
try that do not trade in violence or spectacle. They report uncritically on Islam bash­
ers, such as the radical right-wing radio host Michael Savage, as ifhis ultra-extremist
racist views are a legitimate part of the American mainstream. In the age of zom­
bie politics, there is too little public outrage or informed public anger over the push­
ing of millions of people out of their homes and jobs, the defunding of schools, and
the rising tide of homeless families and destitute communities. Instead of organized,
massive protests against casino capitalism, the American public is treated to an end­
less and arrogant display of wealth, greed, and power. Armies of zombies tune in
to gossip-laden entertainment, game, and realityTV shows, transfixed by the empty
lure of celebrity culture.

The roaming hordes of celebrity zombie intellectuals work hard to fuel a sense
of misguided fear and indignation toward democratic politics, the social state, and
immigrants-all of which is spewed out in bitter words and comes terribly close to
inciting violence. Zombies love death-dealing institutions, which accounts for why
they rarely criticize the bloated military budget and the rise of the punishing state
and its expanding prison system. They smile with patriotic glee, anxious to further
the demands of empire as automated drones kill innocent civilians-conveniently
dismissed as collateral damage-and the torture state rolls inexorably along in
Afghanistan, Iraq, and in other hidden and unknown sites. The slaughter that
inevitably follows catastrophe is not new, but the current politics of death has
reached new heights and threatens to transform a weak democracy into a full­
fledged authoritarian state.

ZOMBIE POLITICS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE THREAT OF AUTHORITARIANISM | 5
A TURN TO THE DARK SIDE o|= Potmcs

The American media, large segments of the public, and many educators widely
believe that authoritarianism is alien to the political landscape of American soci­
ety. Authoritarianism is generally associated with tyranny and governments that
exercise power in violation of the rule of law. A commonly held perception of the
American public is that authoritarianism is always elsewhere. It can be found in
other allegedly “less developed/ civilized countries,” such as contemporary China or
Iran, or it belongs to a fixed moment in modern history, often associated with the
rise of twentieth-century totalitarianism in its different forms in Germany, Italy, and
the Soviet Union under Stalin. Even as the United States became more disposed
to modes of tyrannical power under the second Bush administration-demon­
strated, for example, by the existence of secret CIA prisons, warrantless spying on
Americans, and state-sanctioned kidnaping-mainstream liberals, intellectuals,
journalists, and media pundits argued that any suggestion that the United States was
becoming an authoritarian society was simply preposterous. For instance, the jour­
nalist _lames Traub repeated the dominant view that whatever problems the United
States faced under the Bush administration had nothing to do with a growing
authoritarianism or its more extreme form, totalitarianism.9 On the contrary,
according to this position, America was simply beholden to a temporary seizure of
power by some extremists, who represented a form of political exceptionalism and
an annoying growth on the body politic. In other words, as repugnant as many of
Bush’s domestic and foreign policies might have been, they neither threatened nor
compromised in any substantial way America’s claim to being a democratic society.
Against the notion that the Bush administration had pushed the United States
close to the brink of authoritarianism, some pundits have argued that this dark
moment in America’s history, while uncharacteristic ofa substantive democracy, had
to be understood as temporary perversion of American law and democratic ideals
that would end when George W. Bush concluded his second term in the White
House. In this view, the regime of George W. Bush and its demonstrated contempt
for democracy was explained away as the outgrowth of a random act of politics­
a corrupt election and the bad-faith act of a conservative court in 2000 or a poor­
ly run election campaign in 2004 by an uncinematic and boring Democratic
candidate. According to this narrative, the Bush-Cheney regime exhibited such
extreme modes of governance in its embrace of an imperial presidency, its violation
of domestic and international laws, and its disdain for human rights and democra­
tic values that it was hard to view such anti-democratic policies as part of a perva­
sive shift toward a hidden order of authoritarian politics, which historically has
existed at the margins of American society It would be difficult to label such a gov­
ernment other than as shockingly and uniquely extremist, given a political legacy
that included the rise of the security and torture state; the creation of legal illegal­
ities in which civil liberties were trampled; the launching of an unjust war in Iraq
legitimated through official lies; the passing of legislative policies that drained the
federal surplus by giving away more than a tril.lion dollars in tax cuts to the rich; the
enactment of a shameful policy of preemptive war; the endorsement of an inflated
military budget at the expense of much-needed social programs; the selling off of
as many government fiinctions as possible to corporate interests; the resurrection of
an imperial presidency; an incessant attack against unions; support for a muzzled
and increasingly corporate-controlled media; the government production of fake
news reports to gain consent for regressive policies; the use of an Orwellian vocab­
ulary for disguising monstrous acts such as torture (“enhanced interrogation tech­
niques”); the furtherance of a racist campaign of legal harassment and incarceration
of Arabs, Muslims, and immigrants; the advancement of a prison binge through a
repressive policy of criminalization; the establishment of an unregulated and ulti­
mately devastating form of casino capitalism; the arrogant celebration and support
for the interests and values of big business at the expense of citizens and the com­
mon good; and the dismantling of social services and social safety nets as part of a
larger campaign of ushering in the corporate state and the reign of finance capital?

AuT|-|oR|TAR|AN|sM wm-| A FR|ENoLY FACE

In the minds of the American public, the dominant media, and the accommodat­
ing pundits and intellectuals, there is no sense of how authoritarianism in its soft
and hard forms can manifest itself as anything other than horrible images of con­
centration camps, goose-stepping storm troopers, rigid modes of censorship, and
chilling spectacles of extremist government repression and violence. That is, there
is little understanding of how new modes of authoritarian ideology, policy, values,
and social relations might manifest themselves in degrees and gradations so as to
create the conditions for a distinctly undemocratic and increasingly cruel and
oppressive social order. As the late Susan Sontag suggested in another context, there
is a willful ignorance of how emerging registers of power and govemance “dissolve
politics into pathology.”10 It is generally believed that in a constitutional democ­
racy, power is in the hands of the people, and that the long legacy of democratic
ideals in America, however imperfect, is enough to prevent democracy from being
subverted or lost. And yet the lessons of history provide clear examples of how the
emergence of reactionary politics, the increasing power of the military; and the power
of big business subverted democracy in Argentina, Chile, Germany, and Italy. In
spite of these histories, there is no room in the public imagination to entertain what
has become the unthinkable-that such an order in its contemporary form might
be more nuanced, less theatrical, more cunning, less concerned with repressive
modes of control than with manipulative modes of consent-what one might call
a mode of authoritarianism with a distinctly American character.11

Historical conjunctures produce different forms of authoritarianism, though
they all share a hatred for democracy, dissent, and civil liberties. It is too easy to
believe in a simplistic binary logic that strictly categorizes a country as either
authoritarian or democratic, which leaves no room for entertaining the possibility
of a mixture of both systems. American politics today suggests a more updated if
not a different form of authoritarianism. ln this context, it is worth remembering
what Huey Long said in response to the question of whether America could ever
become fascist: “Yes, but we will call it anti-fascist.”12 Long’s reply suggests that fas­
cism is not an ideological apparatus frozen in a particular historical period but a
complex and often shifting theoretical and political register for understanding how
democracy can be subverted, if not destroyed, from within. This notion of soft or
iiiendly fascism was articulated in 1985 in Bertram Gross’s book F1-imdb: Fascism,
in which he argued that if fascism came to the United States it would not embody
the same characteristics associated with fascist forms in the historical past. There
would be no Nuremberg rallies, doctrines of racial superiority, governrnent-sanc­
tioned book burnings, death camps, genocidal purges, or the abrogation of the U.S.
Constitution. In short, fascism would not take the form of an ideological grid from
the past simply downloaded onto another country under different historical con­
ditions. Gross believed that fascism was an ongoing danger and had the ability to
become relevant under new conditions, taking on familiar forms of thought that res­
onate with nativist traditions, experiences, and political relations.13 Similarly, in his
Anatomy q’Fascism, Robert O. Paxton argued that the texture of American fascism
would not mimic traditional European forms but would be rooted in the language,
symbols, and culture of everyday life. He writes: “No swastikas in an American fas­
cism, but Stars and Stripes (or Stars and Bars) and Christian crosses. No fascist
salute, but mass recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance. These symbols contain no
whiH` of fascism in themselves, of course, but an American fascism would transform
them into obligatory litmus tests for detecting the intemal enemy.”14lt is worth not­
ing that Umberto Eco, in his discussion of “eternal fascism,” also argued that any
updated version of fascism would not openly assume the mantle of historical fas­
cism; rather, new forms of authoritarianism would appropriate some of its elements,
making it virtually unrecognizable from its traditional forms. Like Gross and
Paxton, Eco contended that fascism, if it comes to America, will have a different
guise, although it will be no less destructive of democracy. He wrote:

Ur-Fascism [Eternal Fascism] is still around us, sometimes in plainclothes. lt would be much
easier for us if there appeared on the world scene somebody saying, “I want to reopen
Auschwitz, l want the Blackshirts to parade again in the Italian squares.” Life is not that sim­
ple. Ur-Fascism can come back under the most innocent of disguises. Our duty is to uncov­
er it and to point our finger at any of its new instances-every day, in every part of the
world.15

The renowned political theorist Sheldon Wolin, in Democracy Incorporateai updates
these views and argues persuasively that the United States has produced its own
unique form of authoritarianism, which he calls “inverted totalitarianism.”16 Wolin
claims that under traditional forms of totalitarianism, there are usually founding texts
such as Mein Kampf rule by a personal demagogue such as Adolf Hitler, political
change enacted by a revolutionary movement such as the Bolsheviks, the constitu­
tion rewritten or discarded, the political state’s firm control over corporate interests,
and an idealized and all-encompassing ideology used to create a unified and total­
izing understanding of society. At the same time, the government uses all the
power of its cultural and repressive state apparatuses to fashion followers in its own
ideological image and collective identity.

In the United States, Wolin argues that an emerging authoritarianism appears
to take on a very different form.17 Instead of a charismatic leader, the government
is now governed through the anonymous and largely remote hand of corporate
power and finance capital. Political sovereignty is largely replaced by economic sov­
ereignty as corporate power takes over the reins of governance. The dire conse­
quence, as David Harvey points out, is that “raw money power wielded by the few
undermines all semblances of democratic governance. The pharmaceutical compa­
nies, health insurance and hospital lobbies, for example, spent more than $133 mil­
lion in the first three months of 2009 to make sure they got their way on health care
reform in the United States.”18 The more money influences politics the more cor­
rupt the political culture becomes. Under such circumstances, holding office is
largely dependent on having huge amounts of capital at one’s disposal, while laws
and policies at all levels of government are mostly fashioned by lobbyists represent­
ing big business corporations and commanding financial institutions. Moreover, as
the politics of health care reform indicate, such lobbying, as corrupt and unethical
as it may be, is not carried out in the open and displayed by insurance and drug com­
panies as a badge of honor-a kind of open testimonial to the disrespect for demo­
cratic governance and a celebration of their power. The subversion of democratic
governance in the United States by corporate interests is captured succinctly by Chris
Hedges in his observation that
Corporations have 35,000 lobbyists in Washington and thousands more in state capitals that
dole out corporate money to shape and write legislation. They use their political action com­
ZOMBIE POLITICS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE THREAT OF AUTHORITARIANISM | 9
mittees to solicit employees and shareholders for donations to fund pliable candidates. The
'financial sector, for example, spent more than $5 billion on political campaigns, influenc[e]
peddling and lobbying during the past decade, which resulted in sweeping deregulation, the
gouging of consumers, our global financial meltdown and the subsequent looting ofthe U.S.
Treasury The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America spent $26 million
last year and clmg companies such as Pfizer, Amgen and Eli Lilly kicked in tens of millions
more to buy off the two parties. These corporations have made sure our so-called health
reform bil] will force us to buy their predatory and defective products. The oil and gas indus­
try, the coal industry; defense contractors and telecommunications companies have thwart­
ed the drive for sustainable energy and orchestrated the steady erosion of civil liberties.
Politicians do corporate bidding and stage hollow acts of political theater to keep the fic­
tion of the democratic state alive.19

Rather than being forced to adhere to a particular state ideology, the general pub­
lic in the United States is largely depoliticized through the influence of corporations
over schools, higher education, and other cultural apparatuses. The deadening of
public values, civic consciousness, and critical citizenship is also the result of the work
of anti-public intellectuals representing right-wing ideological and financial inter­
ests,20 dominant media that are largely center-right, and a market-driven public
pedagogy that reduces the obligations of citizenship to the endless consumption and
discarding of commodities. In addition, a pedagogy of social and political amnesia
works through celebrity culture and its counterpart in corporate-driven news, tele­
vision, radio, and entertainment to produce a culture of stupidity, censorship, and
diversionary spectacles.

DEPOLITICIZING FREEDOM AND AGENCY

Agency is now defined by a neoliberal concept of Eeedom, a notion that is largely
organized according to the narrow notions of individual self-interest and limited to
the freedom from constraints. Central to this concept is the freedom to pursue one’s
self-interests independently of larger social concerns. For individuals in a con­
sumer society, this often means the freedom to shop, own guns, and define rights
without regard to the consequences for others or the larger social order. When
applied to economic institutions, this notion of freedom often translates into a call
for removing government regulation over the market and economic institutions. This
notion ofa deregulated and privatized Heedom is decoupled from the common good
and any understanding of individual and social responsibility It is an unlimited
notion of freedom that both refuses to recognize the importance of social costs and
social consequences and has no language for an ethic that calls us beyond ourselves,
that engages our responsibility to others. Within this discourse of hyper-individu­
alized freedom, individuals are not only “liberated from the constraints imposed by
the dense network of social bonds,” but are also “stripped of the protection which
had been matter-of-factly offered in the past by that dense network of social
bonds.”21

Freedom exclusively tied to personal and political rights without also enabling
access to economic resources becomes morally empty and politically dysfunction­
al. The much-heralded notion of choice associated with personal and political free­
dom is hardly assured when individuals lack the economic resources, knowledge, and
social supports to make such choices and freedoms operative and meaningful. As
Zygmunt Bauman points out, “The right to vote (and so, obliquely and at least in
theory, the right to influence the composition of the ruler and the shape ofthe rules
that bind the ruled) could be meaningfully exercised only by those ‘who possess suf­
ficient economic and cultural resources’ to be ‘safe from the voluntary or involun­
tary servitude that cuts off any possible autonomy of choice (and/or its delegation)
at the root... _[Choice] stripped of economic resources and political power hardly
assure [s] personal freedoms to the dzlvpossessed, who have no claim on the resources
without which personal freedom can neither be won nor in practice enjoyed.”22 Paul
Bigioni has argued that this flawed notion of freedom played a central role in the
emerging fascist dictatorships of the early twentieth century. He writes:

It was the liberals of that era who clamored for unfettered personal and economic freedom,
no matter what the cost to society. Such untrammeled freedom is not suitable to civilized
humans. It is the freedom of the jungle. In other words, the strong have more of it than the
weak. It is a notion of Eeedom that is inherently violent, because it is enjoyed at the expense
of others. Such a notion of freedom legitimizes each and every increase in the wealth and
power of those who are already powerful, regardless of the misery that will be suffered by
others as a result. The use of the state to limit such “freedom” was denounced by the lais­
sez-faire liberals ofthe early 20th century The use of the state to protect such “freedom” was
fascism. _lust as monopoly is the ruin of the free market, fascism is the ultimate degradation
of liberal capitalism.”

This stripped-down notion of market-based freedom that now dominates American
society cancels out any viable notion of individual and social agency. This market­
driven notion of freedom emphasizes choice as an economic function defined
largely as the right to buy things while at the same time cancelling out any active
understanding of freedom and choice as the right to make rational choices concern­
ing the very structure of power and governance in a society. In embracing a passive
attitude toward freedom in which power is viewed as a necessary evil, a conserva­
tive notion of freedom reduces politics to the empty ritual of voting and is incapable
of understanding freedom as a form of collective, productive power that enables “a
notion of political agency and freedom that affirms the equal opportunity of all to
exercise political power in order to participate in shaping the most important deci­
sions affecting their 1ives.”24 This merging ofthe market-based understanding of
freedom as the freedom to consume and the conservative-based view of freedom as
a restriction from all constraints refuses to recognize that the conditions for sub­
stantive freedom do not lie in personal and political rights alone; on the contrary,
real choices and freedom include the individual and collective ability to actively
intervene in and shape both the nature of politics and the myriad forces bearing
down on everyday life-a notion of freedom that can only be viable when social
rights and economic resources are available to individuals. Of course, this notion of
freedom and choice is often dismissed either as a vestige of socialism or simply
drowned out in a culture that collapses all social considerations and notions of sol­
idarity into the often cruel and swindle-based discourse of instant gratmcation and
individual gain. Under such conditions, democracy is managed through the empty
ritual of elections; citizens are largely rendered passive observers as a result of giv­
ing undue influence to corporate power in shaping all of the essential elements of
political govemance and decision making; and manufactured appeals to fear and per­
sonal safety legitimate both the suspension of civil liberties and the expanding
powers of an imperial presidency and the policing functions of a militaristic state.

I believe that the formative culture necessary to create modes of education,
thought, dialogue, critique, and critical agency-the necessary conditions of any
aspiring democracy-is largely destroyed through the paciiication of intellectuals
and the elimination of public spheres capable of creating such a culture. Elements
of a depoliticizing and commodifying culture become clear in the shameless pro­
paganda produced by the so-called “embedded” jotunalists, while a corporate-dom­
inated popular culture largely operates through multiple technologies, screen
cultures, and video games that trade endlessly in images of violence, spectacles of
consumption, and stultifying modes of (il)literacy Funded by right-wing ideolog­
ical, corporate, and militaristic interests, an army of anti-public intellectuals groomed
in right-wing think tanks and foundations, such as the American Enterprise
Institute and Manhattan Institute, dominate the traditional media, police the uni­
versities for any vestige of critical thought and dissent, and endlessly spread their
message of privatization, deregulation, and commercialization, exercising a power­
iiil influence in the dismantl_ing of all public spheres not dominated by private and
commodifying interests. These “experts in legitimation,” to use Antonio Gramsci’s
prescient phrase, peddle civic ignorance just as they renounce any vestige of public
accountability for big business, giant media conglomerates, and financial megacor­
porations. How else to explain that nearly twenty percent of the American people
believe incorrectly that Obama is a Muslim!

Under the new authoritarianism, the corporate state and the punishing state
merge as economics drives politics, and repression is increasingly used to contain
all those individuals and groups caught in an expanding web of destabilizing
inequality and powerlessness that touches everything from the need for basic health
care, food, and shelter to the promise of a decent education. As the social state is
hollowed out under pressure &om free-market advocates, right-wing politicians, and
conservative ideologues, the United States has increasingly turned its back on any
semblance of social justice, civic responsibility, and democracy itself This might
explain the influentialjoumalist Thomas Friedman’s shameless endorsement of mil­
itary adventurism in the New York Times article in which he argues that “The hid­
den hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist-McDonald’s cannot
flourish without McDonnell Douglas, the designer ofthe U. S. Air Force F-15 . And
the hidden fist that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley’s technologies to flour­
ish is called the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.”25 Freedom in this
discourse is inextricably wedded to state and military violence and is a far cry from
any semblance of a claim to democracy.

Another characteristic of an emerging authoritarianism in the United States is the
correlation between the growing atomization ofthe individual and the rise of a cul­
ture of cruelty, a type of zombie politics in which the living dead engage in forms
of rapacious behavior that destroy almost every facet of a substantive democratic
polity. There is a mode of terror rooted in a neoliberal market-driven society that
numbs many people just as it wipes out the creative faculties of imagination, mem­
ory and critical thought. Under a regime of privatized utopias, hyper-individual­
ism, and ego-centered values, human beings slip into a kind of ethical somnolence,
indifferent to the plight and suffering of others. Though writing in a different con­
text, the late Franléurt School theorist Leo Lowenthal captured this mode of ter­
ror in his comments on the deeply sedimented elements of authoritarianism rooted
in modern civilization. He wrote:

In a system that reduces life to a chain of disconnected reactions to shock, personal com­
munication tends to lose all meaning... .The individual under terrorist conditions is never
alone and always alone. I-Ie becomes numb and rigid not only in relation to his neighbor but
also in relation to himself; fear robs him of the power of spontaneous emotional or mental
reaction. Thinking becomes a stupid crime; it endangers his life. The inevitable conse­
quence is that stupidity spreads as a contagious disease among the terrorized population.
Human beings live in a state of stupor, in a moral coma.

I. The Rise of Zombie Politics

In the world of popular culture, zombies seem to be everywhere, as evidenced by
the relentless slew of books, movies, video games, and comics. From the haunt­
ing Night qftbe Living Dead to the comic movie Zoméie/and, the figure ofthe zom­
bie has captured and touched something unique in the contemporary imagination.
But the dark and terrifying image of the zombie with missing body parts, oozing
body fluids, and an appetite for fresh, living, human brains does more than feed the
mass-marketing machines that prey on the spectacle of the violent, grotesque, and
ethically comatose. There is more at work in this wave of fascination with the
grotesquely walking hyper-dead than a Hollywood appropriation of the dark
recesses and unrestrained urges of the human mind. The zombie phenomenon is
now on display nightly on television alongside endless examples of destruction
unfolding in real-time. Such a cultural fascination with proliferating images of the
living hyper-dead and unrelenting human catastrophes that extend from a global
economic meltdown to the earthquake in Haiti to the ecological disaster caused by
the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico signals a shift away fiom the hope that accom­
panies the living to a politics of cynicism and despair. The macabre double move­
ment between “the dead that walk”2 and those who are alive but are dying and
suffering cannot be understood outside of the casino capitalism that now shapes
every aspect of society in its own image. A casino capitalist zombie politics views
competition as a form of social combat, celebrates war as an extension of politics,
and legitimates a ruthless Social Darwinism in which particular individuals and
groups are considered simply redundant, disposable-nothing more than human
waste left to stew in their own misfortune-easy prey for the zombies who have a
ravenous appetite for chaos and revel in apocalyptic visions filled with destruction,
decay, abandoned houses, burned-out cars, gutted landscapes, and trashed gas sta­
tions.

The twenty-first-century zombies no longer emerge from the grave; they now
inhabit the rich environs ofWall Street and roam the halls of the gilded monuments
of greed such as Goldman Sachs. As an editorial in The Ne-w York Times points out,
the new zombies of free-market fundamentalism turned “the financial system into
a casino. Like gambling, the transactions mostly just shified paper money around
the globe. Unlike gambling, they packed an enormous capacity for collective and
economic destruction-hobbling banks that made bad bets, freezing credit and eco­
nomic activity Society-not the bankers-bore the cost.”3 In this way the zombie­
the immoral, sub-Nietzschean, id-driven “other” who is “hyper-dead” but still alive
as an avatar of death and cruelty-provides an apt metaphor for a new kind of
authoritarianism that has a grip on contemporary politics in the United States.4 This
is an authoritarianism in which mindless self-gratification becomes the sanctioned
nonn and public issues collapse into the realm of privatized anger and rage. The rule
of the market offers the hyper-dead an opportunity to exercise unprecedented
power in American society, reconstructing civic and political culture almost entire­
ly in the service of a politics that fuels the friend/ enemy divide, even as democra­
cy becomes the scandal of casino capitalism-its ultimate humiliation.

But the new zombies are not only wandering around in the banks, investment
houses, and death chambers of high finance, they have an ever-increasing presence
in the highest reaches of government and in the forefront of mainstream media. The
growing numbers of zombies in the mainstream media have huge iinancial back­
ing from the corporate elite and represent the new face of the culture of cruelty and
hatred in the second Gilded Age. Any mention of the social state, putting limits on
casino capitalism, and regulating corporate zombies puts Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck,
Rush Limbaugh, and other talking heads into a state of high rage. They disparage
any discourse that embraces social justice, social responsibility, and human rights.
Appealing to “real” American values such as family, God, and Guns, they are in the
forefront of a zombie politics that opposes any legislation or policy designed to lessen
human suffering and promote economic and social progress. As Arun Gupta points
out, they are insistent in their opposition to “civil rights, school desegregation,
women’s rights, labor organizing, the minimum wage, Social Security, LGBT
rights, welfare, immigrant rights, public education, reproductive rights, Medicare,
[and] Medicaid.”5 The walking hyper-dead even oppose providing the extension of
unemployment benefits to millions of Americans who are out of work, food, and
hope. They spectacularize hatred and trade in lies and misinformation. They make
populist appeals to the people while legitimating the power of the rich. They appeal
to common sense as a way of devaluing a culture of questioning and critical
exchange. Unrelenting in their role as archetypes of the hyper-dead, they are mis­
anthropes trading in fear, hatred, and hyper-nationalism.

The human suffering produced by the walking hyper-dead can also be seen in
the nativist apoplexy resulting in the racist anti-immigration laws passed in Arizona,
the attempts to ban ethnic studies in public schools, the rise ofthe punishing state,
the social dumping of millions of people of color into prisons, and the attempts of
Tea Party fanatics and politicians who Want to “take back America” from President
Barack Obama-described in the new lexicon of right-wing political illiteracy as
both an alleged socialist and the new Hitler. Newt Gingrich joins Glenn Beck and
other members of the elite squad of the hyper-dead in arguing that Obama is just
another version of _loseph Stalin. For Gingrich and the rest of the zombie ideologues,
any discourse that advocates for social protections, easing human suffering, or
imagining a better future is dismissed by being compared to the horrors ofthe Nazi
holocaust. Dystopian discourse and End Times morbidity rule the collective con­
sciousness of this group.

The “death panels” envisaged by Sarah Palin are not going to emerge from
Obama’s health care reform plan but from the toolkits the zombie politicians and
talking heads open up every time they are given the opportunity to speak. The death
threats, vandalism, and crowds shouting homophobic slurs at openly gay U. S.
House Representative Barney Frank already speak to a fixation with images of death,
violence, and war that now grips the country. Sarah Palin’s infamous call to a gath­
ering of her followers to “reload” in opposition to President Obama’s policies-soon
followed in a nationally televised press conference with a request for the American
people to embrace Arizona’s new xenophobic laws-makes her one of the most
prominent ofthe political zombies. Not only has she made less-than-vague endorse­
ments of violence in many of her public speeches, she has cheerfully embraced the
new face of white supremacy in her recent unapologetic endorsement of racial pro­
4 | |NTRoDucT|oN
filing, stating in a widely reported speech that “It’s time for Americans across this
great country to stand up and say, ‘We’re all Arizonians now.’”6 The current descent
into racism, ignorance, corruption, and mob idiocy makes clear the degree to which
politics has become a sport for zombies rather than engaged and thoughtful citi­
zens.7

The hyper-dead celebrate talk radio haters such as Rush Limbaugh, whose
fanaticism appears to pass without criticism in the mainstream media. Limbaugh
echoes the fanatics who whipped up racial hatred in Weimar Germany, the ideo­
logical zombies who dissolved the line between reason and distortion-laden propa­
ganda. I-Iow else to explain his claim “that environmentalist terrorists might have
caused the ecological disaster in the gulf ”?8 The ethically frozen zombies that
dominate screen culture believe that only an appeal to self-interest motivates peo­
ple-a convenient counterpart to a culture of cruelty that rebukes, if not disdains,
any appeal to the virtues of a moral and just society. They smile at their audiences
while collapsing the distinction between opinions and reasoned arguments. They
report on Tea Party rallies while feeding the misplaced ideological frenzy that
motivates such gatherings but then refuse to comment on rallies all over the coun­
try that do not trade in violence or spectacle. They report uncritically on Islam bash­
ers, such as the radical right-wing radio host Michael Savage, as ifhis ultra-extremist
racist views are a legitimate part of the American mainstream. In the age of zom­
bie politics, there is too little public outrage or informed public anger over the push­
ing of millions of people out of their homes and jobs, the defunding of schools, and
the rising tide of homeless families and destitute communities. Instead of organized,
massive protests against casino capitalism, the American public is treated to an end­
less and arrogant display of wealth, greed, and power. Armies of zombies tune in
to gossip-laden entertainment, game, and realityTV shows, transfixed by the empty
lure of celebrity culture.

The roaming hordes of celebrity zombie intellectuals work hard to fuel a sense
of misguided fear and indignation toward democratic politics, the social state, and
immigrants-all of which is spewed out in bitter words and comes terribly close to
inciting violence. Zombies love death-dealing institutions, which accounts for why
they rarely criticize the bloated military budget and the rise of the punishing state
and its expanding prison system. They smile with patriotic glee, anxious to further
the demands of empire as automated drones kill innocent civilians-conveniently
dismissed as collateral damage-and the torture state rolls inexorably along in
Afghanistan, Iraq, and in other hidden and unknown sites. The slaughter that
inevitably follows catastrophe is not new, but the current politics of death has
reached new heights and threatens to transform a weak democracy into a full­
fledged authoritarian state.

A TURN TO THE DARK SIDE OF POLITICS

The American media, large segments of the public, and many educators widely
believe that authoritarianism is alien to the political landscape of American soci­
ety. Authoritarianism is generally associated with tyranny and governments that
exercise power in violation of the rule of law. A commonly held perception of the
American public is that authoritarianism is always elsewhere. It can be found in
other allegedly “less developed/ civilized countries,” such as contemporary China or
Iran, or it belongs to a fixed moment in modern history, often associated with the
rise of twentieth-century totalitarianism in its different forms in Germany, Italy, and
the Soviet Union under Stalin. Even as the United States became more disposed
to modes of tyrannical power under the second Bush administration-demon­
strated, for example, by the existence of secret CIA prisons, warrantless spying on
Americans, and state-sanctioned kidnaping-mainstream liberals, intellectuals,
journalists, and media pundits argued that any suggestion that the United States was
becoming an authoritarian society was simply preposterous. For instance, the jour­
nalist _lames Traub repeated the dominant view that whatever problems the United
States faced under the Bush administration had nothing to do with a growing
authoritarianism or its more extreme form, totalitarianism.9 On the contrary,
according to this position, America was simply beholden to a temporary seizure of
power by some extremists, who represented a form of political exceptionalism and
an annoying growth on the body politic. In other words, as repugnant as many of
Bush’s domestic and foreign policies might have been, they neither threatened nor
compromised in any substantial way America’s claim to being a democratic society.

Against the notion that the Bush administration had pushed the United States
close to the brink of authoritarianism, some pundits have argued that this dark
moment in America’s history, while uncharacteristic ofa substantive democracy, had
to be understood as temporary perversion of American law and democratic ideals
that would end when George W. Bush concluded his second term in the White
House. In this view, the regime of George W. Bush and its demonstrated contempt
for democracy was explained away as the outgrowth of a random act of politics­
a corrupt election and the bad-faith act of a conservative court in 2000 or a poor­
ly run election campaign in 2004 by an uncinematic and boring Democratic
candidate. According to this narrative, the Bush-Cheney regime exhibited such
extreme modes of governance in its embrace of an imperial presidency, its violation
of domestic and international laws, and its disdain for human rights and democra­
tic values that it was hard to view such anti-democratic policies as part of a perva­
sive shift toward a hidden order of authoritarian politics, which historically has
existed at the margins of American society It would be difficult to label such a gov­
ernment other than as shockingly and uniquely extremist, given a political legacy
that included the rise of the security and torture state; the creation of legal illegal­
ities in which civil liberties were trampled; the launching of an unjust war in Iraq
legitimated through official lies; the passing of legislative policies that drained the
federal surplus by giving away more than a tril.lion dollars in tax cuts to the rich; the
enactment of a shameful policy of preemptive war; the endorsement of an inflated
military budget at the expense of much-needed social programs; the selling off of
as many government fiinctions as possible to corporate interests; the resurrection of
an imperial presidency; an incessant attack against unions; support for a muzzled
and increasingly corporate-controlled media; the government production of fake
news reports to gain consent for regressive policies; the use of an Orwellian vocab­
ulary for disguising monstrous acts such as torture (“enhanced interrogation tech­
niques”); the furtherance of a racist campaign of legal harassment and incarceration
of Arabs, Muslims, and immigrants; the advancement of a prison binge through a
repressive policy of criminalization; the establishment of an unregulated and ulti­
mately devastating form of casino capitalism; the arrogant celebration and support
for the interests and values of big business at the expense of citizens and the com­
mon good; and the dismantling of social services and social safety nets as part of a
larger campaign of ushering in the corporate state and the reign of finance capital?

AUTHORITARIANISM WITH A FRIENDLY FACE

In the minds of the American public, the dominant media, and the accommodat­
ing pundits and intellectuals, there is no sense of how authoritarianism in its soft
and hard forms can manifest itself as anything other than horrible images of con­
centration camps, goose-stepping storm troopers, rigid modes of censorship, and
chilling spectacles of extremist government repression and violence. That is, there
is little understanding of how new modes of authoritarian ideology, policy, values,
and social relations might manifest themselves in degrees and gradations so as to
create the conditions for a distinctly undemocratic and increasingly cruel and
oppressive social order. As the late Susan Sontag suggested in another context, there
is a willful ignorance of how emerging registers of power and govemance “dissolve
politics into pathology.”10 It is generally believed that in a constitutional democ­
racy, power is in the hands of the people, and that the long legacy of democratic
ideals in America, however imperfect, is enough to prevent democracy from being
subverted or lost. And yet the lessons of history provide clear examples of how the
emergence of reactionary politics, the increasing power of the military; and the power
of big business subverted democracy in Argentina, Chile, Germany, and Italy. In
ZOMBIE POLITICS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE THREAT OF AUTHORITARIANISM | 7
spite of these histories, there is no room in the public imagination to entertain what
has become the unthinkable-that such an order in its contemporary form might
be more nuanced, less theatrical, more cunning, less concerned with repressive
modes of control than with manipulative modes of consent-what one might call
a mode of authoritarianism with a distinctly American character.11

Historical conjunctures produce different forms of authoritarianism, though
they all share a hatred for democracy, dissent, and civil liberties. It is too easy to
believe in a simplistic binary logic that strictly categorizes a country as either
authoritarian or democratic, which leaves no room for entertaining the possibility
of a mixture of both systems. American politics today suggests a more updated if
not a different form of authoritarianism. ln this context, it is worth remembering
what Huey Long said in response to the question of whether America could ever
become fascist: “Yes, but we will call it anti-fascist.”12 Long’s reply suggests that fas­
cism is not an ideological apparatus frozen in a particular historical period but a
complex and often shifting theoretical and political register for understanding how
democracy can be subverted, if not destroyed, from within. This notion of soft or
iiiendly fascism was articulated in 1985 in Bertram Gross’s book F1-imdb: Fascism,
in which he argued that if fascism came to the United States it would not embody
the same characteristics associated with fascist forms in the historical past. There
would be no Nuremberg rallies, doctrines of racial superiority, governrnent-sanc­
tioned book burnings, death camps, genocidal purges, or the abrogation of the U.S.
Constitution. In short, fascism would not take the form of an ideological grid from
the past simply downloaded onto another country under different historical con­
ditions. Gross believed that fascism was an ongoing danger and had the ability to
become relevant under new conditions, taking on familiar forms of thought that res­
onate with nativist traditions, experiences, and political relations.13 Similarly, in his
Anatomy q’Fascism, Robert O. Paxton argued that the texture of American fascism
would not mimic traditional European forms but would be rooted in the language,
symbols, and culture of everyday life. He writes: “No swastikas in an American fas­
cism, but Stars and Stripes (or Stars and Bars) and Christian crosses. No fascist
salute, but mass recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance. These symbols contain no
whiH` of fascism in themselves, of course, but an American fascism would transform
them into obligatory litmus tests for detecting the intemal enemy.”14lt is worth not­
ing that Umberto Eco, in his discussion of “eternal fascism,” also argued that any
updated version of fascism would not openly assume the mantle of historical fas­
cism; rather, new forms of authoritarianism would appropriate some of its elements,
making it virtually unrecognizable from its traditional forms. Like Gross and
Paxton, Eco contended that fascism, if it comes to America, will have a different
guise, although it will be no less destructive of democracy. He wrote:

Ur-Fascism [Eternal Fascism] is still around us, sometimes in plainclothes. lt would be much
easier for us if there appeared on the world scene somebody saying, “I want to reopen
Auschwitz, l want the Blackshirts to parade again in the Italian squares.” Life is not that sim­
ple. Ur-Fascism can come back under themost innocent of disguises. Our duty is to uncov-
er it and to point our finger at any of its new instances-every day, in every part of the
world.15

The renowned political theorist Sheldon Wolin, in Democracy Incorporateai updates
these views and argues persuasively that the United States has produced its own
unique form of authoritarianism, which he calls “inverted totalitarianism.”16 Wolin
claims that under traditional forms of totalitarianism, there are usually founding texts
such as Mein Kampf rule by a personal demagogue such as Adolf Hitler, political
change enacted by a revolutionary movement such as the Bolsheviks, the constitu­
tion rewritten or discarded, the political state’s firm control over corporate interests,
and an idealized and all-encompassing ideology used to create a unified and total­
izing understanding of society. At the same time, the government uses all the
power of its cultural and repressive state apparatuses to fashion followers in its own
ideological image and collective identity.

In the United States, Wolin argues that an emerging authoritarianism appears
to take on a very different form.17 Instead of a charismatic leader, the government
is now governed through the anonymous and largely remote hand of corporate
power and finance capital. Political sovereignty is largely replaced by economic sov­
ereignty as corporate power takes over the reins of governance. The dire conse­
quence, as David Harvey points out, is that “raw money power wielded by the few
undermines all semblances of democratic governance. The pharmaceutical compa­
nies, health insurance and hospital lobbies, for example, spent more than $133 mil­
lion in the first three months of 2009 to make sure they got their way on health care
reform in the United States.”18 The more money influences politics the more cor­
rupt the political culture becomes. Under such circumstances, holding office is
largely dependent on having huge amounts of capital at one’s disposal, while laws
and policies at all levels of government are mostly fashioned by lobbyists represent­
ing big business corporations and commanding financial institutions. Moreover, as
the politics of health care reform indicate, such lobbying, as corrupt and unethical
as it may be, is not carried out in the open and displayed by insurance and drug com­
panies as a badge of honor-a kind of open testimonial to the disrespect for demo­
cratic governance and a celebration of their power. The subversion of democratic
governance in the United States by corporate interests is captured succinctly by Chris
Hedges in his observation that
Corporations have 35,000 lobbyists in Washington and thousands more in state capitals that
dole out corporate money to shape and write legislation. They use their political action com­
ZOMBIE POLITICS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE THREAT OF AUTHORITARIANISM | 9
mittees to solicit employees and shareholders for donations to fund pliable candidates. The
'financial sector, for example, spent more than $5 billion on political campaigns, influenc[e]
peddling and lobbying during the past decade, which resulted in sweeping deregulation, the
gouging of consumers, our global financial meltdown and the subsequent looting ofthe U.S.
Treasury The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America spent $26 million
last year and clmg companies such as Pfizer, Amgen and Eli Lilly kicked in tens of millions
more to buy off the two parties. These corporations have made sure our so-called health
reform bil] will force us to buy their predatory and defective products. The oil and gas indus­
try, the coal industry; defense contractors and telecommunications companies have thwart­
ed the drive for sustainable energy and orchestrated the steady erosion of civil liberties.
Politicians do corporate bidding and stage hollow acts of political theater to keep the fic­
tion of the democratic state alive.19

Rather than being forced to adhere to a particular state ideology, the general pub­
lic in the United States is largely depoliticized through the influence of corporations
over schools, higher education, and other cultural apparatuses. The deadening of
public values, civic consciousness, and critical citizenship is also the result of the work
of anti-public intellectuals representing right-wing ideological and financial inter­
ests,20 dominant media that are largely center-right, and a market-driven public
pedagogy that reduces the obligations of citizenship to the endless consumption and
discarding of commodities. In addition, a pedagogy of social and political amnesia
works through celebrity culture and its counterpart in corporate-driven news, tele­
vision, radio, and entertainment to produce a culture of stupidity, censorship, and
diversionary spectacles.

DEPOLITICIZING FREEDOM AND AGENCY

Agency is now defined by a neoliberal concept of Eeedom, a notion that is largely
organized according to the narrow notions of individual self-interest and limited to
the freedom from constraints. Central to this concept is the freedom to pursue one’s
self-interests independently of larger social concerns. For individuals in a con­
sumer society, this often means the freedom to shop, own guns, and define rights
without regard to the consequences for others or the larger social order. When
applied to economic institutions, this notion of freedom often translates into a call
for removing government regulation over the market and economic institutions. This
notion ofa deregulated and privatized Heedom is decoupled from the common good
and any understanding of individual and social responsibility It is an unlimited
notion of freedom that both refuses to recognize the importance of social costs and
social consequences and has no language for an ethic that calls us beyond ourselves,
that engages our responsibility to others. Within this discourse of hyper-individu­
alized freedom, individuals are not only “liberated from the constraints imposed by
the dense network of social bonds,” but are also “stripped of the protection which
had been matter-of-factly offered in the past by that dense network of social
bonds.”21

Freedom exclusively tied to personal and political rights without also enabling
access to economic resources becomes morally empty and politically dysfunction­
al. The much-heralded notion of choice associated with personal and political free­
dom is hardly assured when individuals lack the economic resources, knowledge, and
social supports to make such choices and freedoms operative and meaningful. As
Zygmunt Bauman points out, “The right to vote (and so, obliquely and at least in
theory, the right to influence the composition of the ruler and the shape ofthe rules
that bind the ruled) could be meaningfully exercised only by those ‘who possess suf­
ficient economic and cultural resources’ to be ‘safe from the voluntary or involun­
tary servitude that cuts off any possible autonomy of choice (and/or its delegation)
at the root... _[Choice] stripped of economic resources and political power hardly
assure [s] personal freedoms to the dzlvpossessed, who have no claim on the resources
without which personal freedom can neither be won nor in practice enjoyed.”22 Paul
Bigioni has argued that this flawed notion of freedom played a central role in the
emerging fascist dictatorships of the early twentieth century. He writes:

It was the liberals of that era who clamored for unfettered personal and economic freedom,
no matter what the cost to society. Such untrammeled freedom is not suitable to civilized
humans. It is the freedom of the jungle. In other words, the strong have more of it than the
weak. It is a notion of Eeedom that is inherently violent, because it is enjoyed at the expense
of others. Such a notion of freedom legitimizes each and every increase in the wealth and
power of those who are already powerful, regardless of the misery that will be suffered by
others as a result. The use of the state to limit such “freedom” was denounced by the lais­
sez-faire liberals ofthe early 20th century The use of the state to protect such “freedom” was
fascism. _lust as monopoly is the ruin of the free market, fascism is the ultimate degradation
of liberal capitalism.”

This stripped-down notion of market-based freedom that now dominates American
society cancels out any viable notion of individual and social agency. This market­
driven notion of freedom emphasizes choice as an economic function defined
largely as the right to buy things while at the same time cancelling out any active
understanding of freedom and choice as the right to make rational choices concern­
ing the very structure of power and governance in a society. In embracing a passive
attitude toward freedom in which power is viewed as a necessary evil, a conserva­
tive notion of freedom reduces politics to the empty ritual of voting and is incapable
of understanding freedom as a form of collective, productive power that enables “a
notion of political agency and freedom that affirms the equal opportunity of all to
exercise political power in order to participate in shaping the most important deci­
sions affecting their 1ives.”24 This merging ofthe market-based understanding of
freedom as the freedom to consume and the conservative-based view of freedom as
a restriction from all constraints refuses to recognize that the conditions for sub­
stantive freedom do not lie in personal and political rights alone; on the contrary,
real choices and freedom include the individual and collective ability to actively
intervene in and shape both the nature of politics and the myriad forces bearing
down on everyday life-a notion of freedom that can only be viable when social
rights and economic resources are available to individuals. Of course, this notion of
freedom and choice is often dismissed either as a vestige of socialism or simply
drowned out in a culture that collapses all social considerations and notions of sol­
idarity into the often cruel and swindle-based discourse of instant gratmcation and
individual gain. Under such conditions, democracy is managed through the empty
ritual of elections; citizens are largely rendered passive observers as a result of giv­
ing undue influence to corporate power in shaping all of the essential elements of
political govemance and decision making; and manufactured appeals to fear and per­
sonal safety legitimate both the suspension of civil liberties and the expanding
powers of an imperial presidency and the policing functions of a militaristic state.

I believe that the formative culture necessary to create modes of education,
thought, dialogue, critique, and critical agency-the necessary conditions of any
aspiring democracy-is largely destroyed through the paciiication of intellectuals
and the elimination of public spheres capable of creating such a culture. Elements
of a depoliticizing and commodifying culture become clear in the shameless pro­
paganda produced by the so-called “embedded” jotunalists, while a corporate-dom­
inated popular culture largely operates through multiple technologies, screen
cultures, and video games that trade endlessly in images of violence, spectacles of
consumption, and stultifying modes of (il)literacy Funded by right-wing ideolog­
ical, corporate, and militaristic interests, an army of anti-public intellectuals groomed
in right-wing think tanks and foundations, such as the American Enterprise
Institute and Manhattan Institute, dominate the traditional media, police the uni­
versities for any vestige of critical thought and dissent, and endlessly spread their
message of privatization, deregulation, and commercialization, exercising a power­
iiil influence in the dismantl_ing of all public spheres not dominated by private and
commodifying interests. These “experts in legitimation,” to use Antonio Gramsci’s
prescient phrase, peddle civic ignorance just as they renounce any vestige of public
accountability for big business, giant media conglomerates, and financial megacor­
porations. How else to explain that nearly twenty percent of the American people
believe incorrectly that Obama is a Muslim!

Under the new authoritarianism, the corporate state and the punishing state
merge as economics drives politics, and repression is increasingly used to contain
all those individuals and groups caught in an expanding web of destabilizing
inequality and powerlessness that touches everything from the need for basic health
care, food, and shelter to the promise of a decent education. As the social state is
hollowed out under pressure &om free-market advocates, right-wing politicians, and
conservative ideologues, the United States has increasingly turned its back on any
semblance of social justice, civic responsibility, and democracy itself This might
explain the influentialjoumalist Thomas Friedman’s shameless endorsement of mil­
itary adventurism in the New York Times article in which he argues that “The hid­
den hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist-McDonald’s cannot
flourish without McDonnell Douglas, the designer ofthe U. S. Air Force F-15 . And
the hidden fist that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley’s technologies to flour­
ish is called the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.”25 Freedom in this
discourse is inextricably wedded to state and military violence and is a far cry from
any semblance of a claim to democracy.

ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY

Another characteristic of an emerging authoritarianism in the United States is the
correlation between the growing atomization ofthe individual and the rise of a cul­
ture of cruelty, a type of zombie politics in which the living dead engage in forms
of rapacious behavior that destroy almost every facet of a substantive democratic
polity. There is a mode of terror rooted in a neoliberal market-driven society that
numbs many people just as it wipes out the creative faculties of imagination, mem­
ory and critical thought. Under a regime of privatized utopias, hyper-individual­
ism, and ego-centered values, human beings slip into a kind of ethical somnolence,
indifferent to the plight and suffering of others. Though writing in a different con­
text, the late Franléurt School theorist Leo Lowenthal captured this mode of ter­
ror in his comments on the deeply sedimented elements of authoritarianism rooted
in modern civilization. He wrote:

In a system that reduces life to a chain of disconnected reactions to shock, personal com­
munication tends to lose all meaning... .The individual under terrorist conditions is never
alone and always alone. I-Ie becomes numb and rigid not only in relation to his neighbor but
also in relation to himself; fear robs him of the power of spontaneous emotional or mental
reaction. Thinking becomes a stupid crime; it endangers his life. The inevitable conse­
quence is that stupidity spreads as a contagious disease among the terrorized population.
Human beings live in a state of stupor, in a moral coma.26

Implicit in Lowenthal’s commentary is the assumption that as democracy becomes
a fiction, the moral mechanisms of language, meaning, and ethics collapse, and a
cruel indifference takes over diverse modes of communication and exchange, often
as a register of the current paucity of democratic values, identities, and social rela­
tions. Surely, this is obvious today as all vestiges of the social compact, social
responsibility, and modes of solidarity give way to a form of Social Darwinism with
its emphasis on ruthlessness, cruelty, war, violence, hyper modes of masculinity, and
a disdain for those considered weak, dependent, alien, or economically unproduc­
tive. A poverty of civic ideals is matched not only by a poverty of critical agency but
also by the disappearance among the public of the importance of moral and social
responsibilities. As public life is commercialized and commodified, the pathology
of individual entitlement and narcissism erodes those public spaces in which the con­
ditions for conscience, decency, self-respect, and dignity take root. The delusion of
endless growth coupled with an “obsession with wealth creation, the cult of priva­
tization [and] uncritical admiration for unfettered markets, and disdain for the pub­
lic sector” has produced a culture that seems “consumed by locusts” in “an age of
pygmies.”27

This culture of cruelty is especially evident in the hardships and deprivations
now visited upon many young people in the United States. We have 13.3 million
homeless children; one child in five lives in poverty; too many are now under the
supervision of the criminal justice system, and many more young adults are unem­
ployed and lack any hope for the 5.1ture.28 Moreover, we are subjecting more and
more children to psychiatric drugs as a way of controlling their alleged unruly
behavior while providing huge profits for drug companies. As Evelyn Pringle points
out, “in 2006 more money was spent on treating mental disorders in children aged
0 to 17 than for any other medical condition, with a total of $8.9 billion.”29
Needless to say, the drugging of American children is less about treating genuine
mental disorders than it is about punishing so-called unruly children, largely chil­
dren of the poor, while creating “lifelong patients and repeat customers for
Pharma!”30 Stories abound about poor young people being raped, beaten, and
dying in juvenile detention centers, needlessly trafficked into the criminal justice sys­
tem as part ofa profit-making scheme cooked up by corrupt judges and private cor­
rection facilities administrators, and being given powerful antipsychotic medicines
in schools and other state facilities.31 Unfortunately, this regression to sheer
Economic Darwinism is not only evident in increasing violence against young
people, cutthroat reality TV shows, hate radio, and the Internet, it is also on Hill dis­
play in the discourse of government officials and politicians and serves as a regis­
ter of the prominence of both a kind of political infantilism and a culture of cruelty

For instance, the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, recently stated in an inter­
view in February 2010 that “the best thing that happened to the education system
in New Orleans was Hurricane Katrina.”32 Duncan’s point, beyond the incredible
inhumanity reflected in such a comment, was that it took a disaster that uprooted
thousands of individuals and families and caused enormous amounts of suffering
to enable the Obama administration to implement a massive educational system
pushing charter schools based on market-driven principles that disdain public val­
ues, if not public schooling itselfi This is the language of cruelty and zombie politi­
cians, a language indifferent to the ways in which people who suffer great tragedies
are expelled from their histories, narratives, and right to be human. Horrible
tragedies caused in part by government indifference are now covered up in the dis­
course and ideals inspired by the logic of the market. This mean and merciless streak
was also on display recently when Lieutenant Governor Andre Bauer, who is run­
ning for the Republican nomination for governor in South Carolina, stated that giv­
ing people government assistance was comparable to “feeding stray animals.” The
utterly derogatory and implicitly racist nature of his remark became obvious in the
statement that followed: “You know why? Because they breed. You’re facilitating the
problem if you give an animal or a person ample food supply. They will reproduce,
especially ones that don’t think too much further than that. And so what you’ve got
to do is you’ve got to curtail that type of behavior. They don’t know any better.”33
Lowenthal’s argument that in an authoritarian society “stupidity spreads as a
contagious disease” is evident in a statement made by Michele Bachmann, a
Republican congresswoman, who recently argued that “Americans should purchase
[health] insurance with their own tax-free money.”34 That 43 million Americans
are without health insurance because they cannot afford it seems lost on Bachmann,
whose comments suggest that these uninsured individuals, families, unemployed
workers, and children are not simply a disposable surplus but actually invisible and
therefore unworthy of any acknowledgment.

The regressive politics and moral stupidity are also evident in the emergence
of right-wing extremists now taking over the Republican Party. This new and
aggressive political formation calls for decoupling market-driven financial institu­
tions from any vestige of political and governmental constraint, celebrates emotion
over reason, treats critical intelligence as a toxin possessed largely by elites, wraps
its sophomoric misrepresentations in an air of beyond-interrogation “we’re just
folks” insularity, and calls for the restoration of a traditional, white, Christian,
male-dominated A_merica.35 Such calls embody elements of a racial panic that are
evident in all authoritarian movements and have increasingly become a defining fea­
ture of a Republican Party that has sided with far-right-wing thugs and goon
squads intent on disrupting any vestige of the democratic process. This emerging
authoritarian element in American political culture is embodied in the wildly pop­
ular media presence of Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck-right-wing extremists
who share a contempt for reason and believe in organizing politics on the model of
war, unconditional surrender, personal insults, hyper-masculine spectacles, and the
complete destruction of one’s opponent.

The culture of cruelty, violence, and slander was on full display as the Obama
administration successfully passed a weak version of health care reform in 2010.
Stoked by a Republican Party that has either looked away or in some cases support­
ZOMBIE POLITICS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE THREAT OF AUTHORITARIANISM | I5
ed the coded language of racism and violence, it was no surprise that there was bare­
ly a peep out of Republican Party leaders when racial and homophobic slurs were
hurled by Tea Party demonstrators at civil rights legend _Ion Lewis and openly gay
Barney Frank, both finn supporters of the Obama health policies. Even worse is the
nod to trigger-happy right-wing advocates of violence that conservatives such as
Sarah Pa.lin have suggested in their response to the passage of the health care bill.

For instance, Frank Rich argues that
this bill that inspired G.O.R congressmen on the House floor to egg on disruptive protest­
ers even as they were being evicted from the gallery by the Capitol Police last Sunday. lt’s
this bill that prompted a congressman to shout “baby killer" at Bart Stupak, a staunch anti­
abortion Democrat. lt's this bill that drove a demonstrator to spit on Emanuel Cleaver, a black
representative from Missouri. And it’s this “middle-of-the-road” bill, as Obama accurately
calls it, that has incited an unglued firestorm of homicidal rhetoric, from “Kill the bill!" to
Sarah Palin’s cry for her followers to “reload." At least four ofthe House members hit with
death threats or vandalism are among the 20 political targets Palin marks with rifle crosshairs
on a map on her Facebook page.36

There is more at work here than the usual right-wing promotion of bigotry and
ignorance; there is the use of violent rhetoric and imagery that mimics the discourse
of terrorism reminiscent of Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh, dangerous right­
wing militia groups, and other American-style fascists. As Chris Hedges insists,
“The language of violence always presages violence”37 and fuels an authoritarian­
ism that feeds on such excesses and the moral coma that accompanies the inabili­
ty of a society to both question itself and imagine an alternative democratic order.

How else can one read the “homicidal rhetoric” that is growing in America as any­
thing other than an obituary for dialogue, democratic values, and civic courage?
What does it mean for a democracy when the general public either supports or is
silent in the face of widely publicized events such as black and gay members of
Congress being subjected to racist and homophobic taunts, a black congressman
being spit on, and the throwing of bricks through the oHice windows of some leg­
islators who supported the health care bill? What does it mean for a democracy
when there is little collective outrage when Sarah Palin, a leading voice in the
Republican Party, mimics the tactics of vigilantes by posting a map with crosshairs
on the districts of Democrats and urges her supporters on with the shameliil slo­
gan “Don’t Retreat. Instead-RELOADF’ Under such circumstances, the brandish­
ing of assault weapons at right-wing political rallies, the posters and signs comparing
Obama to Hitler, and the ever-increasing chants to “Take Our Country Back”
echoes what Frank Rich calls a “small-scale mimicry of K.ristallnacht.”38 Violence
and aggression are now openly tolerated and in some cases promoted. The chants,
insults, violence, and mob hysteria all portend a dark period in American history­
an historical conjuncture in the death knell for democracy is being written as the
media turn such events into spectacles rather than treat them as morally and polit­
ically repugnant acts more akin to the legacy of fascism than the ideals of an aspir­
ing democracy. All the while the public yawns or, more troubling, engages fantasies
of reloading.

Unfortunately, the problems now facing the United States are legion and fur­
ther the erosion of a civic and democratic culture. Some of the most glaring issues
are massive unemployment; a rotting infrastructure; the erosion of vital public ser­
vices; the dismantling of the social safety net; expanding levels of poverty, especial­
ly for children; and an imprisonment binge largely affecting poor minorities of color.
But such a list barely scratches the surface. In addition, we have witnessed in the
last thirty years the restructuring of public education as either a source of profit for
corporations or an updated version of control modeled after prison culture coupled
with an increasing culture of lying, cruelty, and corruption, all of which belie a demo­
cratic vision of America that now seems imaginable only as a nostalgic rendering
of the founding ideals of democracy.

DANGEROUS AUTHORITARIANISM OR SHRINKING DEMOCRACY?

Needless to say, many would disagree with Wolin’s view that the United States is
in the grip of a new and dangerous authoritarianism that makes a mockery of the
country’s moral claim to being a model of democracy at home and for the rest of
the world. For instance, liberal critic Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor
under President Bill Clinton, refers to America’s changing political landscape as a
“shrinking democracy.”39 For Reich, democracy necessitates three things: “(1)
Important decisions are made in the open. (2) The public and its representatives have
an opportunity to debate them, so the decisions can be revised in light of what the
public discovers and wants. And (3) those who make the big decisions are account­
able to voters.”40 Ifwe apply Reich’s notion of democracy, then it becomes evident
that the use of the term democracy is neither theoretically apt nor politically fea­
sible at the current historical moment as a description of the United States. All of
the conditions he claims are crucial for a democracy are now undermined by finan­
cial and economic interests that control elections, buy off political representatives,
and eliminate those public spheres where real dialogue and debate can take place.
It is diflicult to imagine that anyone looking at a society in which an ultra-rich finan­
cial elite and megacorporations have the power to control almost every aspect of pol­
itics-from who gets elected to how laws are enacted-could possibly mistake this
social order and system of government for a democracy A more appropriate under­
standing of democracy comes from Wolin in his claim that
democracy is about the conditions that make it possible for ordinary people to better their
lives by becoming political beings and by making power responsive to their hopes and
needs. What is at stake in democratic politics is whether ordinary men and women can rec­
ognize that their concerns are best protected and cultivated under a regime whose actions
are governed by principles of commonality, equality, and faimess, a regime in which taking
part in politics becomes a way of staking out and sharing in a common life and its forms of
self-fulfillment. Democracy is not about bowling together but about managing together those
powers that immediately and significantly affect the lives and circumstances of others and
one's self Exercising power can be humbling when the consequences are palpable rather than
statistical-and rather different from wielding power at a distance, at, say, an “undisclosed
bunker somewhere in northem Virginia."41

Wolin ties democracy not merely to participation and accountability but to the
importance of the formative culture necessa.ry for critical citizens and the need for
a redistribution of power and wealth, that is, a democracy in which power is exer­
cised not just for the people by elites but by the people in their own collective inter­
ests. But more importantly, Wolin and others recognize that the rituals of voting
and accountability have become empty in a country that has been reduced to a lock­
down universe in which torture, abuse, and the suspension of civil liberties have
become so normalized that more than half of all Americans now support the use
of torture under some circumstances.” Torture, kidnapping, indefinite detention,
murder, and disappeared “enemy combatants” are typical practices carried out in dic­
tatorships, not in democracies, especially in a democracy that allegedly has a liber­
al president whose election campaign ran on the promise of change and hope.
Maybe it’s time to use a different language to name and resist the registers of
power and ideology that now dominate American society.

While precise accounts of the meaning of authoritarianism, especially fascism,
abound,l have no desire, given its shifting nature, to impose a rigid or universal def­
inition. What is to be noted is that many scholars, such as Kevin Passmore and
Robert O. Paxton, agree that authoritarianism is a mass movement that emerges out
of a failed democracy; and its ideology is extremely anti-liberal, anti-democratic, and
anti-socia1istic.43 As a social order, it is generally characterized by a system of ter­
ror directed against perceived enemies ofthe state; a monopolistic control of the
mass media; an expanding prison system; a state monopoly of weapons; political rule
by privileged groups and classes; control of the economy by a limited number of peo­
ple; unbridled corporatism; “the appeal to emotion and myth rather than reason; the
gloriiication of violence on behalf of a national cause; the mobilization and milita­
rization of civil society; [and] an expansionist foreign policy intended to promote
national greatness.”44 All of these tendencies were highly visible during the former
Bush administration. With the election of Barack Obama to the presidency, there
was a widespread feeling among large sections of the American public and its
intellectuals that the threat of authoritarianism had passed. And yet there are many
troubling signs that in spite of the election of Obama, authoritarian policies not only
continue to unfold unabated within his administration but continue outside of his
power to control them. In this case, antidemocratic forces seem to align with many
of the conditions that make up what Wolin calls the politics of inverted totalitari­
anism.

I think it is fair to say that authoritarianism can permeate the lived relations of
a political culture and social order and can be seen in the ways in which such rela­
tions exacerbate the material conditions of inequality, undercut a sense of individ­
ual and social agency, hijack democratic values, and promote a deep sense of
hopelessness, cynicism, and eventually unbridled anger. This deep sense of cynicism
and despair on the part ofthe polity in the face of unaccountable corporate and polit­
ical power lends credence to Hannah A_rendt’s notion that at the heart of totalitar­
ianism is the disappearance of the thinking, dialogue, and speaking citizens who
make politics possible. Authoritarianism as both an ideology and a set of social prac­
tices emerges within the lives of those marked by such relations, as its proponents
scorn the present while calling for a revolution that rescues a deeply anti-modernist
past in order to revolutionize the future.

Determining for certain whether we are in the midst of a new authoritarian­
ism under the leadership of Barack Obama is difficult, but one thing is clear: any
new form of authoritarianism that emerges in the current time will be much more
powerful and complex in its beliefs, mechanisms of power, and modes of control than
the alleged idealism of one man or one administration. The popular belief, especial­
ly after McCain’s defeat, was that the country had made a break with its morally
transgressive and reactionary past and that Obama signmed not just hope but
political redemption. Such views ignored both the systemic and powerfully orga­
nized financial and economic forces at work in American society while vastly over­
estimating the power of any one individual or isolated group to challenge and
transform them. Even as the current economic meltdown revealed the destructive
and distinctive class character of the fmancial crisis, the idea that the crisis was root­
ed in systemic causes that far exceeded a few bailouts was lost even on liberal econ­
omists such as Paul Krugman,]effrey Sachs, and Joseph Stiglitz.
Within such economic analyses and narratives of political redemption, the
primacy of hope and “critical exuberance” took precedence over the reality of estab­
lished corporate power, ideological interests, and the influence of the military­
industrial complex. As _Iudith Butler warned soon after Obama’s victory, “Obama
is, after all, hardly a leftist, regardless of the attributions of ‘socialism’ proffered by
his conservative opponents. ln what ways will his actions be constrained by party
politics, economic interests, and state power; in what ways have they been compro­
rnised already? lfwe seek through this presidency to overcome a sense of dissonance,
then we will have jettisoned critical politics in favor of an exuberance whose phan­
ZOMBIE POLITICS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE THREAT OF AUTHORITARIANISM | l9
tasmatic dimensions will prove consequential.”45 In retrospect, Butler’s comments
have proven prescient, and the hope that accompanied Obama’s election has now
been tempered by not simply despair but in many quarters outright and legitimate
anger.

If Bush's presidency represented an exceptional anti-democratic moment, it
would seem logical that the Obama administration would have examined, con­
demned, and dismantled policies and practices at odds with the ideals of an aspir­
ing democracy Unfortunately such has not been the case under Obama, at least up
to this point in his administration. Within the past few years, Obama has moved
decidedly to the right, and in doing so has extended some of the worst elements of
the counter-terrorism policies of the Bush administration. He has endorsed the use
of military commissions, argued for the use of indefinite detention with no charges
or legal recourse for Afghan prisoners, extended the USA Patriot Act,46 continued
two wars while expanding the war in Afghanistan, and largely reproduced Bush’s
market-driven approach to school reform.47 As Noam Chomsky points out, Obama
has done nothing to alter the power and triumph of financial liberalization in the
past thirty years.48 He bailed out banks and financial investment institutions at the
expense of the 26.3 million Americans who are either unemployed or do not have
full-tirne jobs along with the millions who have lost their homes. His chief econom­
ic and foreign policy advisors-Tim Geithner, Lawrence Summers, and Robert
Gates-represent a continuation of a military and big business orientation that is
central to the ideologies and power relations of a undemocratic and increasingly
bankrupt economic and political system. While claiming to enact policies designed
to reduce the federal deficit, Obama plans to cut many crucial domestic programs
while increasing military spending, the intelligence budget, and foreign military aid.
Obama has requested a defense budget for 2011 of $708 billion, in addition to call­
ing for $33 billion to finance the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This budget is almost
as large as the rest of the entire world’s defense spending combined. Roger Hodge
provides a usefu.l summary of Obama’s failings, extending from the perversion of
the rule of law to the authoritarian claim of “sovereign immunity.” He writes:
Obama promised to end the war in Iraq, end torture, close Guantanamo, restore the con­
stitution, heal our wounds, and wash our feet. None of these things has come to pass. As pres­
ident, with few exceptions, Obama either has embraced the unconstitutional war powers
claimed by his predecessor or has left the door open for their quiet adoption at some later
date. Leon Panetta, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has declared that the right
to kidnap (known as “extraordinary rendition") foreigners will continue, just as the Bush
administrations expansive doctrine of state secrets continues to be used in court against those
wrongfully detained and tortured by our security forces and allies. Obama has adopted mil­
itary commissions, once an unpardonable oH`ense against our best traditions, to prosecute ter­
rorism cases in which legitimate convictions cannot be obtained .... The principle of habeas
corpus, sacred to candidate Obama as “the essence of who we are,” no longer seems so essen­
tial, and reports continue to surface of secret prisons hidden from due process and the Red
Cross. Waterboarding has been banned, but other “soft” forms of torture, such as sleep depri­
vation and force-feeding, continue-as do the practices, which once seemed so terribly
important to opponents ofthe Bush regime, of presidential signing statements and warrant­
less surveillance. In at least one respect, the Obama Justice Department has produced an
innovation: a claim of “sovereign immunity" in response to a lawsuit seeking damages for ille­
gal spying. Not even the minions of George W. Bush, with their fanciful notions ofthe uni­
tary executive, made use of this constitutionally suspect doctrine, derived from the ancient
common-law assumption that “the King can do no wrong," to defend their clear violations
of the federal surveillance statute.49

Moreover, by giving corporations and unions unlimited freedom to contribute to
elections, the recent Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election
Commission provided a final step in placing the control of politics more firmly in the
hands of big money and large corporations. In this ruling, democracy-like every­
thing else in American culture-was treated as a commodity and offered up to the
highest bidder. As a result, whatever government regulations are imposed on big
business and the financial sectors will be largely ineffective and will do little to dis­
rupt casino capitalism’s freedom from political, economic, and ethical constraints.
Chris Hedges is right in insisting that the Supreme Court’s decision “carried out a
coup d’état in slow motion. The coup is over. We lost. The ruling is one more judi­
cial effort to streamline mechanisms for corporate control. It exposes the myth of
a functioning democracy and the triumph of corporate power....The corporate
state is firmly cemented in place.”50

In light of his conservative, if not authoritarian, policies, Obama’s once-inspir­
ing call for hope has been reduced to what appears to be simply an empty perfor­
mance, one that “favours the grand symbolic gesture over deep structural change
every time.”51 What once appeared as inspired rhetoric has largely been reduced to
fodder for late-night television comics, while for a growing army of angry voters it
has become nothing more than a cheap marketing campaign and disingenuous
diversion in support of moneyed interests and power. Obama’s rhetoric of hope is
largely contradicted by policies that continue to reproduce a world of egotistic
self-referentiality, an insensitivity to human suffering, massive investments in mil­
itary power, and an embrace of those market-driven values that produce enormous
inequalities in wealth, income, and security. There is more at stake here than a pol­
itics of misrepresentation and bad faith. There is an invisible register of politics that
goes far beyond the contradiction between Obama’s discourse and his right-wing
policies. What we must take seriously in Obama’s policies is the absence of anything
that might suggest a fundamental power shift away from casino capitalism to poli­
cies that would develop the conditions “that make it possible for ordinary people
to better their lives by becoming political beings and by making power responsive
to their hopes and needs.”52 In Obama’s world, cutthroat competition is still the
ZOMBIE POLITICS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE THREAT OF AUTHORITARIANISM | 2]
name of the game, and individual choice is still simply about a hunt for bargains.
Lost here is any notion of political and social responsibility for the welfare, auton­
omy, and dignity of all human beings but especially those who are marginalized
because they lack food, shelter,jobs, and other crucial basic needs. But then again,
this is not Obama’s world; it is a political order and mode of economic sovereign­
ty that has been in the making for quite some time and now shapes practically every
aspect of culture, politics, and civic life. In doing so it has largely destroyed any ves­
tige of real democracy in the United States.

I am not suggesting that in light of Obama’s continuation of some of the
deeply structured authoritarian tendencies in American society that people should
turn away from the language of hope, but I am saying that they should avoid a notion
of hope that is as empty as it is disingenuous. What is needed is a language of cri­
tique and hope that mutually inform each other, and engagement in a discourse of
hope that is concretely rooted in real struggles and capable of inspiring a new
political language and collective vision among a highly conservative and fractured
polity. Maybe it is time to shift the critique of Obama away from an exclusive focus
on the policies and practices of his administration and develop a new language, one
with a longer historical purview and deeper understanding of the ominous forces
that now threaten any credible notion of the United States as an aspiring democ­
racy. As Stuart Hall insists, we “need to change the scale of magnification” in order
to make visible the anti-democratic relations often buried beneath the hidden
order of politics that have taken hold in the United States in the last few decades.53
lt may be time to shift the discourse away from focusing on either Obama’s failures
or progressives and others to develop “the organizational power to make mus­
cular demands”54 on the Obama administration. Maybe the time has come to
focus on the ongoing repressive and systemic conditions, institutions, ideologies, and
values that have been developing in American society for the last thirty years,
forces that are giving rise to a unique form of American authoritarianism. I agree
with Sheldon Wolin that the “fixation upon” Obama now “obscures the problems”
we are facing.55 Maybe it is time to imagine what democracy would look like out­
side of what we have come to call capitalism, not simply neoliberalism at its most
extreme manifestation. Maybe it is time to fight for the formative culture and
modes of thought and agency that are the very foundations of democracy. And
maybe it is time to mobilize a militant, far-reaching social movement to challenge
the false claims that equate democracy and capitalism.
lf it is true that a new form of authoritarianism is developing in the United
States, undercutting any vestige of a democratic society, then it is equally true that
there is nothing inevitable about this growing threat. The long and tightening grip
of authoritarianism in American political culture can be resisted and transformed.
This dystopic fixture will not happen if intellectuals, workers, young people, and
diverse social movements unite to create the public spaces and unsettling formative
educational cultures necessary for reimagining the meaning of radical democracy.
In part, this is a pedagogical project, one that recognizes consciousness, agency, and
education as central to any viable notion of politics. lt is also a project designed to
address, critique, and make visible the commonsense ideologies that enable neolib­
eral capitalism and other elements of an emergent authoritarianism to function
alongside a kind of moral coma and political amnesia at the level of everyday life.
But such a project will not take place if the American public cannot recognize how
the mechanisms of authoritarianism have had an impact on their lives, restructured
negatively the notion of freedom, and corrupted power by placing it largely in the
hands of ruling elites, corporations, and different segments of the military and
national security state. Such a project must work to develop vigorous social spheres
and communities that promote a culture of deliberation, public debate, and critical
exchange across a wide variety of cultural and institutional sites in an effort to gen­
erate democratic movements for social change. Central to such a project is the
attempt to foster a new radical imagination as part of a wider political project to cre­
ate the conditions for a broad-based social movement that can move beyond the
legacy of a fractured lefd progressive culture and politics in order to address the total­
ity ofthe society’s problems. This suggests fmding a common ground in which chal­
lenging diverse forms of oppression, exploitation, and exclusion can become part of
a broader challenge to create a radical democracy. We need to develop an educat­
ed and informed public-one that embraces a culture of questioning and puts into
question society’s commanding institutions. Such a citizenry is crucial to the devel­
opment of a critical formative culture organized around a project of autonomy and
mode of politics in which, as Cornelius Castoriadis insists, broader concerns with
power and justice are connected to the need “to create citizens who are critical
thinkers capable of putting existing institutions into question so that democracy
again becomes society’s movement.. .that is to say, a new type of regime in the full
sense of the term.”56 We live in a time that demands a discourse of both critique
and possibility, one that recognizes that without an informed citizenry, collective
struggle, and viable social movements, democracy will slip out of our reach and we
will arrive at a new stage of history marked by the birth of an authoritarianism that
not only disdains all vestiges of democracy but is more than willing to relegate it
to a distant memory.

CONCLUSION

This book was published just as the 0bama administration finished its second year
in office. Initially, hopes were high among large segments of the American public.
The long dark years of war, repression, secrecy, and corruption were rejected by pop­
ular vote, and a brighter day seemed on the horizon, or so it seemed. Obama spoke
a political language that embodied hope, and his earnest embrace of the American
dream appeared to represent the possibility of a more just future. Under Bush, the
United States had come as close to authoritarianism as was possible without giv­
ing up all vestiges of democratic aspirations. The Bush/Cheney regime was the
apotheosis of a new kind of politics in American life, one in which the arrogance
of power and wealth transformed a limited social state into a mode of sovereignty
that not only worked in the interests of rich and powerful corporations but also
increasingly viewed more and more individuals and groups as disposable and
expendable. As politics came to occupy the center of life itself, the welfare state was
transformed into a corporate and punishing state. Problems were no longer viewed
as in need of social and political remedies. Instead, they were criminalized, reduced
to matters of law and order-when law and order weren’t suspended altogether. The
defense ofthe common good, public values, and social protections moved from the
center of political culture to the margins-reduced to an inconvenience, if not a
threat to those who occupied the privileged precincts of power. In the midst of a
militarized culture of fear, insecurity and market-driven values, economics drove pol­
itics to its death-dealing limit, as crucial considerations of justice, ethics, and com­
passion were largely expunged from our political vocabulary, except as objects of
disdain or a weak-kneed liberal nostalgic yearning. It seemed as ifthe living dead
now ruled every commanding aspect of the culture, extending from the media to
popular expression itself.

Tragically, little has changed since Barack Obama took office. The politics of
corruption, death, and despair appear to define the Obama administration as much
as they did the relentless eight years of the Bush regime. This book is an attempt
to develop a new form of political critique forged out of what may seem an extreme
metaphor, the zombie or hyper-dead. Yet the metaphor is particularly apt for draw­
ing attention to the ways in which political culture and power in American society
now working the interests of bare survival, if not disposability, for the vast majori­
ty of people-a kind of war machine and biopolitics committed to the creation of
death-worlds, a new and unique form of social existence in which large segments
of the population live under a state of siege, reduced to a form of social death. The
zombie metaphor does more than Suggest the symbolic face of power, it points dra­
matically to a kind of “mad agency that is power in a new form, death-in-life”57
agency without conscience and bereft of social democratic imagination or hope. This
is what Achille Mbembe calls necropolitics in which “death is the mediator of the
present-the only form of agency left.”58 What is new about this type of politics
is that it is not hidden, lurking in the shadows but appears daily and unremarkably
in memos, reports, and policies justifying illegal legalities such as the use of state
24 | |NTRoDucT|oN
secrets, indefinite detention without charge, the massive incarceration of people of
color, hidden prisons, a world of night raids, the bailout of corrupt corporations that
led to the direct destitution of millions, and the full-fledged attack on a weakened
oppositional culture of thoughtfulness and critique, itself all but left for dead. The
figure of the zombie utilizes the iconography of the living dead to signal a society
that appears to have stopped questioning itself, that revels in its collusion with
human suffering, and is awash in a culture of unbridled materialism and narcissism.
Though not of his making, this is now Obama’s challenge; and yet the politics of
death and suffering continue unabated both in the United States and in America’s
imperial adventures abroad.

This book is an attempt to understand critically both the political and peda­
gogical conditions that have produced this culture of sadism and death, attempt­
ing to mark and chart its visible registers, including the emergence of right-wing
teaching machines, a growing politics of disposability, the emergence of a culture
of cruelty, the ongoing war being waged on young people, and especially on youth
of color. The book begins and ends with an analysis of authoritarianism and the ways
it reworks itself; mutates, and attacks parasitically the desiccated shell of democra­
cy, sucking out its life-blood. The focus on authoritarianism serves as both a warn­
ing as well as a call to critical engagement in the interest of hope-not as a political
rhetoric emptied of context and commitment but one that seeks to resuscitate a
democratic imaginary and energized social movements that is the one antidote to
the zombification of politics.

In the first section of the book, elements of the new authoritarianism are ana­-
lyzed as a death-dealing politics that works its way through a culture of deceit, fear,
humiliation, torture, and market-driven desire for their ever-more “extreme” expres­
sions. Next it focuses on challenging the rise of a politics of illiteracy and the ongo­
ing destruction of democratic public spheres, stressing how the values of casino
capitalism are mobilized through the emergence of market-driven commercial
spheres and public institutions such as schools. The third section ofthe book focus­
es on the figure of youth as a register of the crisis of public values, signaling the
impending crisis of a democratic future. The merging of zombie politics and the
increasing scale of suffering and hardship that young people have to endure in the
United States points to the serious political and ethical consequences of a society
mobilized and controlled by casino capitalism-a capitalism that in its arrogance
and greed takes the side of death and destruction rather than siding with democ­
racy and public life. The figure of the zombie signifies not just a crisis of conscious­
ness but a new type of political power and “mad agency,” visible in the rituals of
economic Darwinism that rule not just reality TV but everyday life. But such a pol­
itics is far from undefeatable, and surely it is not without the continued presence and
possibility of individual and collective resistance. My hope is that this book will break
ZOMBIE POLITICS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE THREAT OF AUTHORITARIANISM | 25
through a diseased common sense that often masks zombie politicians, anti-pub­
lic intellectuals, politics, institutions, and social relations and bring into focus the
need for a new language, pedagogy, and politics in which the living dead will be
moved decisively to the margins rather than occupying the very center of politics and 
everyday life.

SECTION I: ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY

Lies are often much more plausible, more appealing to reason, than reality, since the liar has
the great advantage of knowing beforehand what the audience wishes or expects to hear.
HANNAH Aaemorl
n the current American political landscape, truth is not merely misrepresented
or falsified, it is overtly mocked. As is well known, the Bush administration
repeatedly lied to the American public, furthering a legacy of government mistrust
while carrying the practice of distortion to new and almost unimaginable heights.
Even now, within a few years of Bush’s leaving office, it is difficult to forget the lies
and government-sponsored deceits in which it was claimed that Saddam Hussein
had weapons of mass destruction, Iraq was making deals with Al-Qaeda, and, per­
haps the most infamous of all, the United States did not engage in torture. Unlike
many former administrations, the Bush administration was engaged in pure polit­
ical theater,2 giving new meaning to Hannah Arendt’s claim that “Truthfirlncss has
never been counted among the political virtues, and lies have always been regard­
ed as justifiable tools in political dealings.”3 For instance, when the govemment was­
n’t lying to promote dangerous policies, it willfully produced and circulated fake
news reports in order to provide the illusion that the lies and the policies that flowed
from them were supported by selective members of the media and the larger pub­
lic. The Bush deceits and lies were almost never challenged by right-wing media
"patriots," who were too busy denouncing as un-American anyone who questioned
42 | SECTION IZ ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY
Bush's ofiicial stream of deception and deceit. Ironically, some of these pundits were
actually on the government payroll for spreading the intellectual equivalent of junk
food.
ln such circumstances, language loses any viable sense of referentiality, while
lying, misrepresentation, and the deliberate denial of truth become acceptable prac­
tices frnnly entrenched in the Wild West of talk radio, cable television, and the dom­
inant media. Fact-finding, arguments bolstered by evidence, and informed analysis
have always been fragile entities, but they risk annihilation in a culture in which it
becomes difficult to distinguish between an opinion and an argument. Knowledge
is increasingly controlled by a handful of corporations and public relations firms and
is systemically cleansed of any complexity. Lying and deceittiilness are all too often
viewed as just another acceptable tactic in what has become most visibly the pathol­
ogy of politics and a theater of cruelty dominated by a growing chorus of media hate­
mongers inflaming an authoritarian populist rage laced with a not-too-subtle
bigotry.4
Truth increasingly becomes the enemy of democracy because it does not sup­
port the spectacle and the reduction of citizens either to mere dupes of power or
commodities. Ignorance is no longer a liability in a culture in which lying, deceit,
and misinformation blur the boundaries between informed judgments and the
histrionics of a shouting individual or mob. Talk radio and television talk show
screamers such as Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, and Glenn Beck, in particu­
lar, seem to delight in repeating claims that have been discredited in the public arena,
demonstrating a barely disguised contempt for both the truth and any viable ves­
tige of journalism. These lies and deceits go beyond the classic political gambit,
beyond the Watergate-style cover up, beyond the comic “I did not have sex with that
woman.” The lies and deceptions that are spewed out every day from the right-wing
teaching machines-from newspapers and radio shows to broadcast media and the
Intemet-capitalize on both the mobilizing power of the spectacle, the increasing
impatience with reason, and an obsession with what Susan ]. Douglas describes as
the use of “provocative sound bites over investigative reporting, misinformation over
fact.”5 Lying and deception have become so commonplace in the dominant press
that such practices appear to have no moral significance and provoke few misgiv­
ings, even when they have important political consequences.
In the age of public relations managers and talk show experts, we are witness­
ing the demise of public life. At a time when education is reduced to training work­
ers and is stripped of any civic ideals and critical practices, it becomes unfashionable
for the public to think critically. Rather than intelligence uniting us, a collective igno­
rance of politics, culture, the arts, history, and important social issues, as Mark Slouka
points out, “gives us a sense of community it confers citizenship.”6 Our political pas­
sivity is underscored by a paucity of intellectual engagemcnt,just as the need for dis­
THE POLITICS or LYING AND THE CULTURE OF DECETT IN oBAMA's AMERICA | 43
crete judgment and informed analysis falls prey to a culture of watching, a culture
of illusion and circus tricks. Shame over the lying and ignorance that now shape our
cultural politics has become a source of national pride-witness the pathetic
response to ]oe Wilson’s outburst against President Obama. Or, for that matter, the
celebrated and populist response to Sarah Pa1in’s lies about death panels, which are
seized upon not because they distort the truth and reveal the dishonesty and vile­
ness of political opportunism-while also unsuccessfully attempting to undermine
a viable health care bill-but because they tap into a sea of growing anger and
hyped-up ignorance and ratchet up poll ratings. Lying and deceit have become the
stuff of spectacle and are on full display in a society where gossip and celebrity cul­
ture rule. In this instance, the consequences of lying are reduced to a matter of pruri­
ence rather than public concern, becoming a source of private injury on the part of
a Hollywood star or producing the individual humiliation of a public figure such
as john Edwards.
The widespread acceptance of lying and deceit is not merely suggestive of a
commodified and ubiquitous corporate-driven electronic culture that displays an
utter contempt for morality and social needs: it also registers the existence of a trou­
bling form of infantilization and depoliticization. Lying as common sense and
deceit as politics-as-usual join the embrace of provocation in a coupling that emp­
ties politics and agency of any substance and feeds into a corporate state and mil­
itarized culture in which matters of judgment, thoughtfulness, morality, and
compassion seem to disappear from public view. What is the social cost of such flight
from reality, if not the death of democratic politics, critical thought, and civic
agency? When a society loses sight of the distinction between fact and fiction, truth­
telling and lying, what happens is that truth, critical thought, and fact-finding as
conditions of democracy are rendered trivial and reduced to a collection of mere plat­
itudes, which in turn reinforces moral indifference and political impotence. Under
such circumstances, language actually becomes the mechanism for promoting polit­
ical powerlessness. Lying and deceit are no longer limited to merely substituting
falsehoods for the truth; they now performatively constitute their own truth, pro­
moting celebrity culture, right-wing paranoia, and modes of government and cor­
porate power freed from any sense of accountability
While all governments resort to misrepresentations and lies, we appear to have
entered a brave new world in which lies, distortions, and exaggerations have become
so commonplace that when something is said by a politician, it is often meant to
suggest its opposite, and without either irony or apology As lies and deceit become
a matter of policy, language loses its grip on reality, and the resulting indetermina­
cy of meaning is often used by politicians and others to embrace positions that
change from one moment to the next. Witness Dick Cheney, who once referred to
torture as “enhanced interrogation” so as to sugarcoat its brutality and then appeared
44 | SECTION IZ ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY
on national television in 2009 only to defend torture by arguing that if such prac­
tices work, they are perfectly justified, even if they violate the law. This is the same
Cheney who, appearing on the May 31, 2005, Larry King Live show, attempted to
repudiate charges of government torture by claiming, without irony, that the
detainees “have been well treated, treated humanely and decently.”This type of dis­
course recalls George Orwel1’s dystopian world of 1984 in which the Ministry of
Truth produces lies and the Ministry of Love tortures people. Remember when the
Bush administration used the “Healthy Forest Initiative" to give loggers access to
protected wilderness areas or the “Clear Skies Initiative" to enable greater industri­
al air pollution? Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, appearing on ABC’s
Good MomingAmerica in january 2010, embraced one of the most sordid lies of the
year with his claim that “We had no domestic attacks under Bush,” as if the attacks
on 9/11 never happened. Of course, there is a certain irony here given that he never
stopped referring to 9/ 11 as a way to shamelessly mobilize support for his own failed
presidential bid. President Obama also indulges in this kind of semantic dishon­
esty when he substitutes “prolonged detention” for the much-maligned “preventive
detention” policies he inherited from the Bush-Cheney regime. While Obama is not
Bush, the use of this type of duplicitous language calls to mind the Orwellian night­
mare in which “war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength.”
When lying and deceit become normalized in a culture, they serve as an index
of how low we have fallen as a literate and civilized society. Such practices also
demonstrate the degree to which language and education have become corrupted,
tied to corporate and political power, and sabotaged by rigid ideologies as part of a
growing authoritarianism that uses the educational force of the culture, the means
of communication, and the sites in which information circulate to mobilize igno­
rance among a misinformcd citizenry, all the while supporting reactionary policies.
Especially since the horrible events of September 11, 2001, Americans have been
encouraged to identify with a militaristic way of life, to suspend their ability to read
the word and world critically, to treat corporate and government power in almost
religious terms, and to view a culture of questioning as something alien and poiso­
nous to American society. Shared fears rather than shared responsibilities now
mobilize angry mobs and gun-toting imbeciles who are praised as “real” Americans.
Fear bolstered by lies and manufactured deceptions makes us immune to even the
most obvious moral indecencies, such as the use of taser guns on kids in schools.
Nobody notices or cares, and one cause and casualty of all of this moral indiffer­
ence is that language has been emptied of its critical content just as the public spaces
that make it possible are disappearing into the anns of corporations, advertisers, and
other powerful institutions that show nothing but contempt for either the public
sphere or the kind of critical literacy that gives it meaning.
Obama’s presence on the national political scene gave literacy, language, and
THE POLITICS OF LYINC AND THE CULTURE OF DECEIT IN OBAMA'S AMERICA | 45
critical thought a newfound sense of dignity, interlaced as they were with a vision
of hope, justice, and possibility-and reasonable arguments about the varied crises
America faced. But as Obama compromised, if not surrendered, some of his prin­
ciples to those individuals and groups that live in the language of duplicity, the ide­
alism that shaped his vocabulary began to look like just another falsehood when
measured against his continuation of a number of Bush-like policies. In this case,
the politics of distortion and misrepresentation that Obama’s lack of integrity has
produced may prove to be even more dangerous than what we got under Bush,
because it wraps itself in a moralism that seems uplifting and hopeful while sup­
porting policies that reward the rich, reduce schools to testing centers, and contin­
ue to waste lives and money on wars that should have ended when Obama assumed
his presidency. Obama claims he is for peace, and yet the United States is the largest
arms dealer in the world. He claims he wants to reduce the deficit but instead spends
billions on the defense industry and wars abroad. He says he wants everyone to have
access to decent health care but makes backroom deals with powerful pharmaceu­
tical companies. Orwell’s ghost haunts this new president and the country at large.
Reducing the critical power of language has been crucial to this effort. Under such
circumstances, democracy as either a moral referent or a political ideal appears to
have lost any measure of credibility. The politics of lying and the culture of deceit
are inextricably related to a theater of cruelty and modes of corrupt power in which
politics is reduced to a ritualized incantation, just as matters of governance are
removed from real struggles over meaning and power.
Beyond disinformation and disguise, the politics of lying and the culture of
deceit trade in and abet the rhetoric of fear in order to manipulate the public into
a state of servile political dependency and unquestioning ideological support. Fear
(and its attendant use of moral panics) not only creates a rhetorical umbrella to pro­
mote right-wing ideological agendas (increased military spending, tax relief for the
rich, privatization, market-driven reforms, and religious intolerance) but also con­
tributes to a sense of helplessness and cynicism throughout the body politic. The
collapse of any vestige of critical literacy, reason, and sustained debate gives way to
falsehoods and forms of ignorance that find expression in the often-racist dis­
course of what Bob Herbert calls “the moronic maestros of right wing radio and
'l`V”7 endlessly haranguing the public to resist any trace of reason. How else to
explain the actions of parents who refiise to let their children listen to a speech on
education by should I say it, an African American president? How else to fathom
the dominant media repeating uncritically the views of right-wing groups that
portray Obama as Hitler or Stalin or consistently making references that compare
him to a gorilla or indulge in other crude racist references? In recent days, these
groups have been given ample media attention, as if their opinions are not simply
ventriloquizing the worst species of ignorance and racism.
46 | sEcT|oN |: zoMB|E POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF Crzusuv
The politics of lying and the culture of deceit are wrapped in the logic of
absolute certainty, an ominous harbinger of a kind of illiteracy in which one no
longer has to be accountable for justifying opinions, claims, or alleged arguments.
Stripped of accountability, language finds its final resting place in a culture of
deceit and arrogance in which lying either is accepted as a political strategy or is
viewed as simply another normalized aspect of everyday life. The lack of criticism
surrounding both government practices and corporations that now exercise unpar­
alleled forms of power is more than shameful; it is an utter capitulation to an
Orwellian rhetoric that only thinly veils an egregious form of authoritarianism and
racism. In the face of such events, we muSt develop a critical discourse to address
the gap between rhetoric and deeds of those who hold economic, political, and social
power. As Hannah Arendt has argued, debate is central to a democratic politics,
along with the public space in which individuals can argue, exercise critical judg­
ment, and clarify their relationship to democratic values and public commitments.
Critical consciousness and autonomy are, after all, not merely the stuff of political
awareness but what makes democratic accountability possible in the first place. They
are also the foundation and precondition for individuals, parents, community
groups, and social movements to mobilize against such political and moral corrup­
tions.
Democracy is fragile and its fate is always uncertain, but during the last decade
we have witnessed those in commanding political and corporate positions exhibit
an utter disregard for the truth, morality, and critical debate. The Enron template
of lying and deception has turned an ethos of dialogue and persuasion into its oppo­
site: dogmatism and propaganda. In doing so, the American public has been bom­
barded by a discourse of fear, hate, and racism, coupled with a politics of lying that
undermines any viable vestige of a democratic ethos. We now find ourselves living
in a society in which right-wing extremists not only wage a war against the truth
but also seek to render human beings less than fully human by taking away their
desire for justice, spiritual meaning, freedom, and individuality.
Politics must become more attentive to those everyday conditions that have
allowed the American public to remain complicitous with such barbaric policies and
practices. Exposing the underlying conditions and symptoms of a culture of lying
and deceit is both a political and a pedagogical task that demands that people speak
out and break through the haze of oflicial discourse, media-induced amnesia, and
the fear-producing lies of corrupt politicians and the swelling ranks of hatemon­
gers. The politics of lying and deceit at the current historical moment offers up the
specter of notjust government abuse, mob hysteria, and potential violence, but also
an incipient authoritarianism, one that avidly seeks to eliminate intelligent delib­
eration, informed public discussion, engaged criticism, and the very possibility of
freedom and a vital democratic politics. The spirit of critique is meaningless with­
THE POLITICS OF LYINC AND THE CULTURE OF DECEIT IN OBAMA'S AMERICA I 47
out literacy and an informed public. For such a public to flourish, it must be sup­
ported with public debate and informed agents capable of becoming both witness­
es to injustice and forces for transforming those political, economic, and institutional
conditions that impose silence and perpetuate human suffering. The distortions,
misrepresentations, and lies that have become an integral part of American culture
present a serious threat to an aspiring democracy, because they further what John
Dewey called the “eclipse of the public,” just as they empty politics of its democ­
ratic values, meanings, and possibilities.
The hate, extremism, and pathology that have come to define our national polit­
ical and popular landscapes-heard repeatedly in the prattle of Sarah Palin and
Glenn Beck, to name only two of the most popular examples-are legitimated by
an appeal to absolute certainty, which becomes the backdrop against which a pol­
itics of lying and a culture of deceit, fear, cruelty and repression flourish. We are wit­
nessing in the politics of lying and the culture of deceit a disconnection between
language and social responsibility, politics and critical education, market interests
and democratic values, privately felt pain and joys and larger public considerations.
Under such circumstances morality becomes painless, if not invisible, while social
responsibility is erased from the vocabulary of mainstream politics and the domi­
nant cultural apparatus. And this undermining of the value of human dignity,
truth, dialogue, and critical thought is the offspring of a debate over much more than
simply meaning and language, or even the widespread legitimacy of individual and
institutional ignorance and corruption. At its core it is a debate about power and
those corporate and political interests that create the conditions in which lying
becomes acceptable and deceit commonplace-those forces that have the power to
frame in increasingly narrow ways the conventions, norms, language, and relations
through which we relate to ourselves and others.
How we define ourselves as a nation cannot be separated from the language we
value, inhabit, and use to shape our understanding of others and the world in
which we want to live. As the language of critique, civic responsibility; political
courage, and democracy disappears along with sustained investments in schools,
media, and other elements of a formative culture that keeps an aspiring democra­
cy alive, we lose the spaces and capacities to imagine a future in which language,
literacy, and hope are on the side of justice, rather than on the side of hate, willful
ignorance, and widespread injustice.

Zombie Language and
the Politics of the Living
Dead
n a robust democratic society, language and critical thought have a liberating
function. At best, they work together to shatter illusions, strengthen the power
of reason and critical judgment, and provide the codes and framing mechanisms for
human beings to exercise a degree of self-determination while holding the throne
of governmental, military, and economic power accountable. Language in such a
society is engaged, critical, dialectical, historical, and creates the conditions for dia­
logue, thoughtfinlness, and informed action. Such a language refuses to be co­
opted in the service of marketing goods, personalities, and sleazy corporations.
Needless to say, it is a language that is troubling and almost always threatening to
the guardians of the status quo. As Toni Morrison points out in another context,
language that is troubling has a way of reading and writing the world, that “can dis­
turb the social oppression that functions like a coma on the population, a coma
despots call peace. . .[that makes visible] the blood flow of war that hawks and prof­
iteers thrill to.”1
In authoritarian societies, language works to produce forms of historical and
social amnesia, using the media, universities, and other sites of public pedagogy to
cover the visual landscape with a coma-inducing ignorance. This political and
moral coma allows the living dead to further experiment with those political mech­
anisms and social filters employed to freeze meaning, limit the discourses of free­
dom, and make certain ideas unspeakable, if not unthinkable. Tales of repression,
cruelty, human suffering, and evil disappear from public memory, becoming invis­
50 | SECTION II ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY
ible as politics works through a zombie-like language to make unjust and repres­
sive power invisible. This type of coma-like amnesia seems to have become one of
the defining features of the new American century. At the same time this language
and the ideologies and modes of goveming are always conditional, open to resis­
tance, and capable of being challenged by new modes of discourse, understanding,
and courage. One example can be seen in the ongoing resistance emerging in Iran
against the state’s use of power to extend its ever-increasing restrictions on the new
media and lntemet to curb the power of the living and vital language of dissent. It
can also be seen in the rewriting of history textbooks by right-wing extremists who
control the Texas State Board of Education. In their attempt to whitewash histo­
ry they have replaced the word capitalism with free-enterprise system, rejected the
separation of church and state as a constitutional principle, injected the importance
of what they call biblical and pro-Confederate values, and replaced references to the
slave trade with the more innocuous “Atlantic triangular trade,” and redefined the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a struggle driven by Islamic fundamentalism.2
Language that is coma producing always serves the interests of the living dead,
becoming zombie-like in its ability to sap the meaning of any political and ethical
substance. Such a language is suffocating, Orwellian in its hypocrisy and death-deal­
ing and cruel in the relationships it often produces and legitimates. For instance,
as Michael Moore points out in his film Capitalismsd Love Story, a number of blue­
chip companies take out insurance policies on their employees without telling
them. Not only do such policies offer tax breaks for the rich, they also provide very
lucrative sums of money for corporations when an employee dies. Irma johnson
found this out the hard way after her husband, Daniel, died of brain cancer. She dis­
covered that the bank that had fired him received close to $4.5 million dollars in
insurance proceeds.3 She got nothing. The corporations refer to these lucrative and
cruel schemes as “dead peasant policies.” This is a discourse in which the living dead
literally benefit from the deaths of their fired employees-zombie politics at its most
transparent and morally repulsive.
At its best, language can invite us to think beyond the given and the realm of
common sense, becoming a poweriiil force for unleashing the power of insight,
imagination, and possibility. Yet we live at a time when language is often deployed
by those with social, political, and economic resources that narrow its horizons, close
down its appeal to truth claims, and empty content of any viable substance. When
employed by those corrupted by power, language is often stripped of elements of
critique, thoughtfiilness, and compassion. Such a language cheapens public values,
the notion of the common good, and increasingly appropriates all potential spaces
for a viable politics through a debased appeal to self-interest, personal fears, money,
and national security.
lf successful, the language of oppression and cruelty becomes normalized,
ZOMBIE LANGUAGE AND THE POLITICS OF THE LIVING DEAD | 5]
removed from the sphere of criticism and the culture of questioning. Such alan­
guage does more than normalize ignorance, illiteracy, and irrationality; it also pro­
duces a kind of psychic hardening and deep-rooted pathology in a society
increasingly willing to eliminate the policies that enable the social bonds and pro­
tections necessary for a substantive democracy. This language of cruelty, a zombie­
inspired discourse of sorts, has been given a new life within the last few decades as
it has become the Iinguafianca of powerful American politicians, corporations, and
many in the dominant media. And it is mobilized to both dismantle the liberating
function of critical reason and to stifle criticisms ofa society that appears to be adrift.
Such a discourse turns hate-talk into a commodity and human suffering into a spec­
tacle.
Rarely do we find a robust language at workin the corporate-mediated public
domains that provides a sustained criticism of an imperial presidency, an econom­
ic system removed from all political and ethical constraints, a debased and debas­
ing celebrity culture, a market-driven notion of consumerism that strips people of
any other vestige of agency, an utter disregard for the lawlessness and inequality
caused by casino capitalism, a permanent war economy and a discourse of contempt
aimed at those marginalized by poverty and race in America. While there are cer­
tainly criticisms of such practices and policies at work in American societyg they are
either marginalized, trivialized, or simply treated with disdain and viewed as irrel­
evant by those in power.
Flashpoints in a culture often signal the rise of this language of cruelty, suggest­
ing ruptures in the democratic fabric of a country that speak to something forebod­
ing in its present and future that is not merely disturbing but portends a new kind
of evil, a gathering storm capable of ushering in a new kind of authoritarianism.
Hurricane Katrina, declarations supporting torture by elected officials, bailouts for
the rich and indifference for the poor, and millions of people sleeping on the street
or in tents signal something new and despairing about American society. The story
continues. For instance, in ]une 2005, Vice President Dick Cheney, in response to
revelations of torture at Guantanamo, claimed that the prisoners in the detention
camp inhabited something similar to Club Med. According to Cheney “They're liv­
ing in the tropics. They’re well fed. 'l`hey’ve got everything they could possibly
want.”4
What is most scandalous about this remark is not the sheer duplicity of the mis­
representation, or even the trivialization of human rights violations, but the attempt
to silence or make disappear an ever-expanding narrative of extreme cruelty and pain
inflicted on the bodies of those who have been forced to inhabit, without any legal
rights, what would be more aptly called Club Torture. We know from a number of
reports and from the leaked images of Abu Ghraib prison that combatants in var­
ious U.S. detention centers have been subjected to the most horrendous forms of
52 | SECTION |: zomals POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY
torture, often severely injured and left to suffer with irreparable mental anguish. In
other instances of torture and abuse, detainees “have been murdered.”5 But there is
more at work in Cheney’s comments than fabrications designed to promote certain
convenient ideological illusions central to the new world order promoted by the
Bush administration. There is also a hidden order of politics that suggests a certain
psychic hardening ofthe culture, the triumph of a debased language and politics over
any semblance of ethics and civic courage-clearly reinforced by the loss of a crit­
ical media, schools that actually teach young people to think critically, and those
public spheres where viable public analyses can take place. This is a new register and
expression of cruelty for the American empire because it now defines itselfunapolo­
getically and with great arrogance through its exercise of what could be appropri­
ately called radical evil.
Evidence of this type of psychic hardening and moral depravity extends far
beyond the more recently revealed torture memos, the media’s embrace of Sarah
Palin’s talk about death panels, the gleeful expressions of racism that are back in fash­
ion, the rise of hate-radio, and the triumphalist justifications for imperial power that
fiiel the language of the likes of Dick Cheney Michael Savage, and Fox News. Even
after President Obama condemned torture and made it illegal once again, those
politicians and lawyers who supported torture and played a prominent role in both
legitimating it and sanctioning it under the Bush administration refused to exhib­
it the slightest bit of self-reflection or remorse over their support for a state that tor­
tures. For instance, in a revealing interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York
Times at the end of November 2009, James Inhofe, a conservative Republican
Senator from Oldahoma, stated that he did not think that the naval base at
Guantanamo should be closed because it was “a real resource."6 Inhofe then talked
about Gitmo-this Gulag for the stateless roundly condemned all over the world­
as if it were a vacation spot generously provided by the U.S. government for
detainees, many of whom were legally but unjustly rendered as part of America's war
on terror. What is even more astounding is that Inhofe seemed completely unwill­
ing to entertain the overwhelming and substantial body of evidence now available
as a matter of public record that proves that many of the detainees at Guantanamo
were subjected by the American government to sexual abuse, human rights viola­
tions, and the systemic practice of torture. He states, without any irony intended:
The people there are treated probably better than they are in the prisons in America. They
have more doctors and medical practitioners per inmate.They’re eating better than anyone
has ever eaten before .... One ofthe big problems is they become obese when they get there
because they’ve never eaten that good beforc.7
There is more than denial and ignorance at work in Inhofe’s answer. It is also symp­
ZOMBIE LANGUAGE AND THE POLITICS OF THE LIVING DEAD | 53
tomatic of a society that is no longer capable of questioning itself, unraveling its abil­
ity to think critically and act in a morally responsible way This is a society in which
language has become so debased and corrupted by power that morality and truth
claims are no longer open to examination, and the consequences spell catastrophe
for democracy. ln another interview, Solomon asked ]ohn Yoo, the former _lustice
Department lawyer and one of the architects of the torture memos, if he regretted
writing the memos, which offered President Bush a legal rationale for ignoring
domestic and international laws prohibiting torture.3 Exhibiting a complete indif­
ference to the moral issue at stake in justifying systemic torture, Yoo provided an
answer not unlike those provided by Nazi war criminals prosecuted at the
Nuremberg military tribunals in 1945. I-Ie stated: “No, I had to write them. It was
my job. As a lawyer, I had a client. The client needed a legal question answered.”9
More recently, it was widely reported in the dominant media that there are over
39 million people on food stamps, and 6 million of these people have no other source
of income. Put another way, “About one in 50 Americans now lives in a household
with a reported income that consists of nothing but a food-stamp card.”l0 These
figures become all the more tragic when we learn that one in four children are on
food stamps. Surely such a story should move the American public to both ques­
tion any society with this degree of inequality and move in some transformative way
to address the needless suffering of millions of people. When the story was report­
ed in T/Je New York Times, it was largely descriptive, the language used was blood­
less, sterile, lacking any sense of either urgency or suggesting the need for political
action on the part of the American public. The one criticism in the article came from
john Linder, a Georgia Republican and a ranking member of the House Panel on
Welfare Policy Displaying what can truly be called a zombie politics and language
only fit for persuading the living dead, he criticized the food stamp program, argu­
ing that “We’re at risk of creating an entire class of people, a subset of people,just
comfortable getting by living off the government.”11 Linder’s use of language mim­
ics the moral depravity we find in the words of hot-shot investment bankers who
hand out billions in bonuses while millions are starving because ofthe financial mar­
kets’ recklessness. For the bankers, bonuses are-as one CEO put it-a form of
God’s work. There is more at play here than ignorance; there is also a deep sense
of scorn for any viable notion ofthe welfare state and the necessity of government
to address in a profound way the needless suffering of those caught in the expand­
ing network of systemic inequality, unemployment, and poverty.
This use of dead language, stripped of insight, ethics, and compassion, has now
become commonplace in America and suggests that we have become a country with
no interest in modes of governance that extend beyond the narrow and often ruth­
less interests of investment bankers, mega-corporations, the ultra-rich, the
54 | SECTION II ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY
Department of Defense, and casino capitalism. Linguistic appeals to present-day
zombies erase any viable notion ofthe social, public sphere, and the common good.
Rather than talk about the responsibilities ofthe welfare state and social safety nets
for the millions of Americans in need, government and corporate spokespersons
employ a language of bare life-devoid of compassion and respect for the other. This
is a language that erases the social and all of the human bonds and conditions nec­
essary to provide human relationships with joy, dignity, hope, justice, and a measure
of moral and social responsibility. The realm of the social, the glue of public life and
the common good, has been utterly privatized within this death-inspired language
and cut off from the political, economic, and moral connections that give society
any viable identity and meaning. As the language of war, finance, and markets dri­
ves politics, matters of ethics, social responsibility, thinking from the place of the
other, and addressing the conditions under which it becomes possible to apprehend
the suffering of others becomes not only difficult but is more often than not treat­
ed with contempt.
Zombie language, with its appeal to the living dead, erases the social as it pri­
vatizes it and can only imagine freedom through the narrow lens of self-interest,
exchange values, and profit margins. Troubles are now privatized, resulting in “yet
more loneliness and impotence, and indeed more uncertainty still.”12 Society in this
view is a network of random connections and disconnections, tied to furthering the
interests of competitive individuals and fueled by a rabid individualism. Zombie lan­
guage is more than Orwellian in that it does not merely offer up illusions, it arro­
gantly celebrates those values, structures, institutions and modes of power that are
on the side of death, the perpetuation of human suffering, and a world-view that
cannot think beyond the maximizing pleasures of grotesque power, wealth, and priv­
ilege.
Cheney, Inhofe, Yoo, the heads of the commanding financial institutions, and
too many others to name exhibit and legitimize the type of zombie language along
with an unethical mode of behavior that is chilling in its moral transgressions and
telling in its reflection of the political and moral corruption that has taken hold of
American culture. But the cruelties and crimes that these individuals, corporations,
and administrations produce as official policy through a language of the living
dead could not have taken place if there were not a formative culture in place in the
United States that in its silence and complicity supported and enabled such a dis­
course and its accompanying acts of barbarism and cruelty Within such a culture,
as _ludith Butler reminds us, it becomes increasingly easy for human life to be sac­
rificed to an instrumental logic, a totalitarian view of authority, and a discourse of
fear. Such a culture loses its moral compass, sanctions cruel polices that produce mas­
sive human suffering and disposability, and in the end becomes unable to entertain
those norms or shared conditions that make human life possible, that apprehend the

dignity of human life or offer the political and moral frameworks “to guard against
injury and violence."13 Under such circumstances, individual rights, protections, and
civil liberties disappear as the most barbaric state-sanctioned practices are carried
out with only minor opposition registered by the American people. Zombie lan­
guage and its accompanying practices and policies are nourished by the egocentric
politics ofa rabid individualism, the punishing values of casino capitalism, and the
harsh logic of privatization in which all problems are now shifted onto the shoul­
ders of individuals, who have to bear the E111 burden of solving them. The culture
of cruelty that emerges in this market-driven ideology and the language that legit­
imates it points not merely to the death of public values or to a society that is polit­
ically adrift, but more importantly to the unleashing of institutions, ideas, values,
and social relations that may lead to the demise of democracy itself

Everyday Violence and
the Culture of Cruelty
Entertaining Democracy's Demise
nder the Bush administration, a seeping, sometimes galloping authoritarian­
ism began to reach into every vestige of the culture, giving free rein to those
anti-democratic forces in which religious, market, militaryg and political fundamen­
talism thrived, casting an ominous shadow over the fate of U.S. democracy. During
the Bush-Cheney regime, power became an instrument of retribution connected
to and fuelled by a repressive state, a kind of zombie state trading in human abuse,
fear, and punishment! A bullying rhetoric of war, a ruthless consolidation of eco­
nomic forces, and an all-embracing, free-market apparatus and media-driven ped­
agogy of fear supported and sustained a distinct culture of cruelty and inequality
in the United States.
ln pointing to a culture of cruelty, I am not employing a form of leftist moral­
ism that collapses matters of power and politics into the discourse of character. On
the contrary, I think the notion of a culture of cruelty is useful in thinking through
the convergence of everyday life and politics, of considering material relations of
power-the disciplining ofthe body as an object of control-on the one hand, and
the production of cultural meaning, especially the co-optation of popular culture
to sanction oliicial violence, on the other. The culture of cruelty is important for
thinking through how life and death now converge in ways that fundamentally
transform how we understand and imagine politics in the current historical
moment-a moment when the most vital elements of the social safety net are being
undermined by right-wing ideologues. What is it about a culture of cruelty that pro­

vides the conditions for many Americans to believe that government is the enemy
of health care reform and health care reform should be tumed over to corporate and
market-driven interests, further depriving millions of an essential right? And while
a weak version of the health care bill has passed, the living undead are vowing to
undo the bill through upcoming elections.
Increasingly, many individuals and groups now find themselves living in a
society that measures the worth of human life in terms of cost-benefit analyses. The
central issue of life and politics is no longer about working to get ahead but strug­
gling simply to survive. And many groups considered marginal because they are poor,
unemployed, people of color, elderly, or young, have not just been excluded from “the
American dream” but have become utterly redundant and disposable, waste prod­
ucts of a society that no longer considers them of any va1ue.2 How else to explain
the zealousness with which social safety nets have been dismantled, the transition
from welfare to workfare (offering little job training programs and no child care),
and the now infamous acrimony over health care reform’s failed public option? What
accounts for the passage of laws that criminalize the conduct of millions of home­
less people in the United States, often defining sleeping, sitting, soliciting, lying
down, or loitering in public places as a criminal offense rather than a behavior in
need of compassionate good will and public assistance? Or, for that matter, the
expulsions, suspensions, segregation, class discrimination, and racism in the public
schools as well as the more severe beatings, broken bones, and damaged lives
endured by young people in the juvenile justice system?
Within this type of zombie politics, largely filelled by a market fundamental­
ism-one that substitutes the power of the social state with the power of the cor­
porate state and only values wealth, money, and consumers-there is a ruthless and
hidden dimension of cruelty, one in which the powers of life and death are increas­
ingly determined by punishing apparatuses, such as the criminal justice system for
poor people of color and/ or market forces that increasingly decide who may live and
who may die.
The growing dominance of right-wing media forged in a pedagogy of hate has
become a crucial element providing numerous platforms for a culture of cruelty and
is fimdamental to how we understand the role of education in a range of sites out­
side of traditional forms of schooling. This educational apparatus and mode of pub­
lic pedagogy are central to analyzing not just how power is exercised, rewarded, and
contested in a growing culture of cruelty, but also how particular identities, desires,
and needs are mobilized in support of an overt racism, hostility toward immi­
grants, and Utter disdain coupled with the threat of mob violence toward any polit­
ical figure supportive of the social contract and the welfare state. Citizens are
increasingly constructed through a language of contempt for all non-commercial
public spheres and a chilling indifference to the plight of others that is increasing­

ly expressed in vicious tirades against big government and almost any form of
social protection, however necessary There is a growing element of scom on the part
of the American public for those human beings caught in a web of misfortune,
human suffering, dependency, and deprivation. As Barbara Ehrenreich observes,
“The pattem is to curtail fmancing for services that might help the poor while ramp­
ing up law enforcement: starve school and public transportation budgets, then
make truancy illegal. Shut down public housing, then make it a crime to be home­
less. Be sure to harass street vendors when there are few other opportunities for
employment. The experience of the poor, and especially poor minorities, comes to
resemble that of a rat in a cage scrambling to avoid erratically administered elec­
tric shocks.”3
A right-wing spin machine, influenced by haters like Rush Limbaugh, Glenn
Beck, Michael Savage, and Ann Coulter endlessly spews out a toxic rhetoric in
which all Muslims are defined as jihadists; the homeless are not victims of misfor­
tune but lazy; blacks are not terrorized by a racist criminal justice system but are the
main architects of a culture of criminality; the epidemic of obesity has nothing to
do with corporations, big agriculture, and advertisers selling junk food but rather
the result of “big” govemment giving people food stamps; the public sphere is
largely for white people, and it is being threatened by immigrants and people of
color, and so it goes. Glenn Beck, the alleged voice of the common man, appear­
ing on the Fox fs’ Friends morning show, calls President Obama a “racist” and
accuses him of “having a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture.”4
Nationally syndicated radio host Rush Limbaugh unapologetically states thatjames
Earl Ray, the confessed killer of Martin Luther King, ]r., should be given a posthu­
mous Medal of I-Ionor,5 while his counterpart in right-wing hate, talk radio host
Michael Savage, states on his show, “You know, when I see a woman walking
around with a burqa, I see a Nazi. That’s what I sewhow do you like that?-a hate­
ful Nazi who would like to cut your throat and kill your children.”6 He also claims
that Obama is “surrounded by terrorists” and is “raping America.” This is a varia­
tion of a crude theme established by Ann Coulter, who refers to Bill Clinton as a
“very good rapist.”7 Even worse, Obama is a “neo-Marxist fascist dictator in the
making” who plans to “force children into a paramilitary domestic army”8 And this
is just a small sampling of the kind of hate talk that permeates right-wing media.
This could be dismissed as loony right-wing political theater if it were not for the
low levels of civic literacy displayed by so many Americans who choose to believe
and invest in this type of hate talk.9 On the contrary while it may be idiocy it reveals,
as I state throughout this book, a powerful set of political, economic, and education­
al forces at work in miseducating the American public while at the same time
extending the culture of cruelty and the politics of the hyper-dead. One central task
of any viable form of politics is to analyze the culture of cruelty and its overt and
60 | SECTION II ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY
covert dimensions of violence, often parading as entertainment.
Underlying the culture of cruelty that reached its apogee during the Bush
administration was the legalization of state violence, such that human suffering was
now sanctioned by the law, which no longer served as a summons to justice. But if
a legal culture emerged that made violence and human suffering socially acceptable,
popular culture rendered such violence pleasurable by commodifying, aestheticiz­
ing, and spectacularizing it. Rather than being unspoken and unseen, violence in
American life had become both visible in its pervasiveness and normalized as a cen­
tral feature of dominant and popular culture. Americans had grown accustomed to
luxuriating in a warm bath of cinematic blood, as young people and adults alike were
seduced with commercial and military video games such as Grand They? Auto and
AmericafrArmy,1° the television series 24 and its ongoing Bacchanalian féte of tor­
ture, the cmde violence on display in World Wrestling Entertainment and Ultimate
Fighting Championship, and an endless series of vigilante films such as The Brave
One (2007), Death Sentence (2007), and Harry Bro-wn (2010), in which the rule of
law is suspended by the viscerally satisfying images of men and women seeking
revenge as laudable killing machines--a nod to the permanent state of emergency
and war in the United States. Symptomatically, there is the mindless glorification
and aestheticization of brutal violence in the most celebrated Hollywood films,
including many of Oyentin Tarantino’s films, especially Deatb Proqf (2007), Kill Bill
I C9’ 2 (2003, 2004), and Inglourious Bastards (2009). With the release of Tarantino’s
2009 bloody war film, in fact, the press reported that Dianne Kruger, the co-star of
Inglourious Basterds, claimed that she “loved being tortured by Brad Pitt [though]
she was frustrated she didn’t get an opportunity to get frislcy with her co-star, but
admits being beaten by Pitt was a satisfying experience."11 This is more than the
aestheticization of violence; it is the normalization and glorification of torture
itself
If Hollywood has made gratuitous violence the main staple of its endless
parade of blockbuster films, television has tapped into the culture of cruelty in a way
that was unimaginable before the attack on the United States on September 11,
2001. Prime-time television before the attacks had “fewer than four acts of torture”
per year, but “now there are more than a hundred.”12 Moreover, the people who tor­
ture are no longer the villains but the heroes of prime-time television. The most cel­
ebrated is, ofcourse, _lack Bauer, the tragic-ethical hero of the wildly popular Fox
TV thriller 24. Not only is torture the main thread of the plot, often presented “with
gusto and no moral compunction,"13 but Bauer is portrayed as a patriot rather than
a depraved monster who tortures in order to protect American lives and national
security. Torture in this scenario takes society’s ultimate betrayal of human dignity
and legitimates the pain and fear it produces as normal, all the while making a “moral
sadist” a television celebrity.” The show, before its final season in 2010, had over
EVERYDAY VIOLENCE AND THE CULTURE or CRUELTY | 6|
15 million viewers, and its glamorization of torture had proven so successful that
it appears not only to have numbed the public’s reaction to the horrors of torture,
but it became so overwhelmingly influential among the U.S. military that the
Pentagon sent Brigadier General Patrick Finnegan to California to meet with the
producers of the show. “I-le told them that promoting illegal behaviour in the
series. . .was having a damaging effect on young troops.”15 The pornographic glo­
rification of gratuitous, sadistic violence is also on full display in the popular I-IBO
television series Dexter, which portrays a serial killer as a sympathetic, even lovable
character.The Starz television series Spartacus: Blood and Sand takes the aesthetic of
blood and violence beyond what one might call the pornography of violence. This
series, a version of Fight Club on steroids, has more in common with the ideology
and mechanisms of the fascist spectacle-at once a celebration of a ruthless form
of hyper-masculinity, Social Darwinism, and an investment in violence as the most
important element of power and mediating force in shaping social relationships.
Violence in this series is more than grotesque; it is morally bankrupt and embraces
the spectacle to both entertain and provoke the most dcbased type ofvoyeurism.1f°
The celebration of hyper-violence and torture travels easily from fiction to real
life with the emergence in the past few years of a proliferation of “bum fight” videos
on the Internet “shot by young men and boys who are seen beating the homeless
or who pay transients a few dollars to fight each other.”17 The culture of cruelty
mimics cinematic violence as the agents of abuse both indulge in actual forms of
violence and then fhrther celebrate the barbarity by posting it on the Web, mimic­
king the desire for fame and recognition, while voyeuristically consuming their own
violent cultural productions. The National Coalition for the Homeless claims that
“On YouTube in July 2009, people have posted 85,900 videos with ‘bum’ in the title
[and] 5,690 videos can be found with the title ‘bum fight,’ representing. . .an increase
of 1,460 videos since April 2008.”13 Rather than problematize violence, popular cul­
ture increasingly normalizes it, often in ways that border on criminal intent. For
instance, a recent issue of Maxim, a popular men’s magazine, included “a blurb titled
‘Hunt the Homeless’ [focusing on] a coming ‘hobo convention’ in Iowa and says ‘Kill
one for fun. We’re 87 percent sure it’s legal.’”19 In this context violence is not sim­
ply being transformed into an utterly distasteful form of adolescent entertainment
or spectacularized to attract readers and boost profits, it becomes a powerful ped­
agogical force in the culture of cruelty by both aligning itself and becoming com­
plicit with the very real surge of violence against the homeless, often committed by
young men and teenage boys looking for a thrill.20 Spurred on by the ever-reassur­
ing presence of violence and dehumanization in the wider culture, these young “thrill
offenders" now search out the homeless and “punch, kick, shoot or set afire people
living on the streets, frequently killing them, simply for the sport of it, their victims
all but invisible to society.”21 All of these elements of popular culture speak stylish­
62 | SECTION IZ ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY
ly and sadistically to new ways in which to maximize the pleasure of violence, giv­
ing it its hip (if fascist) edginess.
Needless to say, neither violent video games and television series nor Hollywood
films and the Internet (or, for that matter, popular culture) cause in any direct sense
real-world violence and suffering, but they do not leave the real world behind, either.
That is too simplistic. What they do achieve is the execution of a well-fiinded and
highly seductive public pedagogical enterprise that sexualizes and stylizes represen­
tations of violence, investing them with an intense pleasure quotient. I don’t believe
it is an exaggeration to claim that the violence of screen culture entertains and
cleanses young people of the burden of ethical considerations when they, for
instance, play video games that enable them to “casually kill the simulated human
beings whose world they control."22 Hollywood films such as the Saw series offer
up a form of torture porn in which the spectacle of the violence enhances not mere­
ly its attraction but offers young viewers a space where questions of ethics and
responsibility are gleefully suspended, enabling them to evade their complicity in
a culture of cruelty. No warnings appear on the labels of these violent videos and
films suggesting that the line between catharsis and desensitization may become
blurred, making it more difficult for them to raise questions about what it means
“to live in a society that produces, markets, and supports such products.”23
But these hyper-violent cultural products also form part of a corrupt pedagog­
ical assemblage and cultural apparatus that makes it all the more difficult to recog­
nize the hard realities of power and material violence at work through militarism,
a winner-take-all economy marked by punishing inequalities, and a national secu­
rity state that exhibits an utter disregard for human suffering. In this version of zom­
bie politics, death is spectacularized in order to evade matters of politics and
power~even the suffering of children, we must note, as when govemment officials
reduce the lives of babies and young children lost in Iraq and Afghanistan to col­
lateral damage. Tragically, the crime here is much more than symbolic.
The ideology of hardness and cruelty runs through American culture like an
electric current, sapping the strength of social relations and individual character,
moral compassion, and collective action, offering up crimes against humanity that
become fodder for video games and spectacularized media infotainment, and con­
structing a culture of cruelty that promotes a “symbiosis of suffering and spectacle.”24
As Chris Hedges argues,
Sadism is as much a part of popular culture as it is of corporate culture. lt dominates
pornography, runs. . .through reality television and trash-talk programs and is at the core of
the compliant, corporate collective. Corporatism is about crushing the capacity for moral
choice. And it has its logical fruition in Abu Ghraib, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and
our Igcsk of compassion for the homeless, our poor, the mentally ill, the unemployed and the
sick.
EVERYDAY VIOLENCE AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY | 63
Bailouts are not going to address the ways in which individual desires, values, and
identities are endlessly produced in the service of a culture of cruelty and inequal­
ity. Power is not merely material, it is also symbolic and is distributed through a soci­
ety in ways we have never seen before. No longer is education about schooling. It
now functions through the educational force of the larger culture in the media,
Internet, electronic media, and through a wide range of technologies and sites
endlessly working to undo democratic values, compassion, and any viable notion of
justice and its accompanying social relations. What this suggests is a redefinition
of both literacy and education. We need as a society to educate students and oth­
ers to be literate in multiple ways, to reclaim the high ground of civic courage, and
to be able to name, engage, and transform those forms of public pedagogy that pro­
duce hate and cruelty as part of the discourse of common sense. Otherwise, democ­
racy will lose the supportive institutions, social relations, and culture that make it
not only possible but even thinkable.

Market-Driven Hysteria
and the Politics of Death
f we take seriously the ideology, arguments, and values now emanating from the
right wing of the Republican Party, there is no room in the United States for a
democracy in which the obligations of citizenship, compassion, and collective
security outweigh the demands of what might be called totalizing market-driven
society, that is, a society that is utterly deregulated, privatized, commodificd, and
largely controlled by the ultra-rich and a handtiil of mega-corporations. In such a
society, there is a shift in power from government to markets and the emergence
of a more intensified political economy organized around three principal con­
cerns: deregulated markets, commodification, and disposability. In spite of the
current failure of this system, right-wing Republicans and their allies are more than
willing to embrace a system that erases all vestiges of the public good, turning cit­
izens into consumers, while privatizing and commodifying every aspect of the
social order-all the while threatening the lives, health, and livelihoods of millions
of working-class and middle-class people.
If we listen to shockjocks on right-wing talk radio and an increasing number
of their ilk in other media-driven spheres, casino capitalism is not only sexy, it pro­
vides an argument against the very notion of politics itself and the power of the gov­
ernment to intervene and protect its citizens from the ravages of nature, corrupt
institutions, and an unregulated market. In this discourse, largely buttressed through
an appeal to fear and the use of outright lies, free-market capitalism assumes an
66 | secrnom |: zomane POLITICS AND THE CULTURE or CRUELTY
almost biblical status as an argument against the power of government to protect
its citizens from misfortune and the random blows of fate by providing the most
basic rights and levels of collective security and protection. Politics in this scenario
is left to the fate of markets and the financial hyper-dead, while everyone else has
to look out for themselves, bereft of any social protections or collective help from
broader social spheres.
Before he died, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt advocated precisely for
such rights, which he called a “second bill of rights,” and which included the right
“of every family to a decent home. The right to adequate medical care and the oppor­
tunity to achieve and enjoy good health. The right to adequate protection from the
economic fears of old age, sickness, accident and unemployment. The right to a good
education." That is, those social and economic rights that provide a secure foun­
dation for people to live with dignity and be free to become critical and engaged cit­
izens, capable of both expanding their own sense of agency and freedom while being
able to work with others to fulfill the demands of an aspiring democracy.
But in the truncated notion of freedom espoused by the right-wing extremists
of casino capitalism, democracy is a deficit, if not a pathology, and freedom is
reduced to the narrow logic of an almost rabid focus on self-interest. As l pointed
out in the Introduction, this is a truncated version of freedom, defined largely as free­
dom from constraint-a freedom which when not properly exercised or balanced
loses its connection to those obligations that tie people to values, issues, and insti­
tutions that affirm “the existence of a common good or a public purpose.”2 Freedom
here operates according to a calculated deficit that reduces agency to a regressive
infantilism, or what Leo Lowenthal called “the atomization of the individual,” ter­
rorized by other human beings, and reduced to “living in a state of stupor, in a moral
coma.”3 This type of depoliticizing inward thinking, with its disavowal of the
obligations of social responsibility and its outright disdain for those who are dis­
advantaged by virtue of being poor, young, or elderly, does more than fuel the
harsh, militarized, and hyper-masculine logic of reality television and extreme
sports. It also elevates death over life, selfishness over compassion, and economics
over politics. But more so, it produces a kind of dysfunctional silence in the culture
in the face of massive hardship and suffering, wiping out society’s collective mem­
ories of moral decency.
There is more than moral indifference and political cynicism at work here.
There is also a culture in which there is not much room for ideals, a culture that now
considers public welfare a pathology, and responsibility solely a privatized and
individual matter. Under this form of zombie politics and mode of casino capital­
ism, people become invested in their own survival, narrowly focused on their own
interests, all the while confirming their regression into a Social Darwinism echoed
daily on reality TV. This is a politics of disinvestment in public life, democracy, and
MARKET°DR|VEN HYSTERIA AND THE POLITICS OF DEATH I 67
the common good. Hence, it is not surprising that we hear nothing from the faux
populists Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O’Reilly and other cheerleaders for an
unchecked capitalism about a market-driven landscape filled with desolate commu­
nities, gutted public services, and weakened labor unions. Nor do they say anything
about a free-market system that in its greed, cruelty, corruption, and iniquitous
power relations creates the conditions responsible for 40 million impoverished
people (many living in their cars or the ever-growing tent cities), and 46 million
Americans, until recently, living without health insurance-one result of which,
according to a Harvard University study, has been the needless deaths of 45,000 peo­
ple every year.4 Nor do they register any alarm over a system that, according to a
recent study released by the _lohns Hopkins Children’s Center, claims that “lack of
adequate health care may have contributed to the deaths of some 17,000 U.S. chil­
dren over the past two decades.”5 What do they have to say about a deregulated mar­
ket system with its corrupt financial institutions shipping jobs abroad, swindling
people out of their homes, and gutting the manufacturing base of U.S. industry?
What do they have to say about a political system largely controlled by corporate
lobbyists? 0r insurance companies that pay employees bonuses when they main­
tain a high level of rejections f`or procedures that can save people’s lives. Not much.
All they see amid this growing landscape of human suffering and despair is the
specter of socialism, which amounts to any government-sponsored program
designed to offer collective insurance in the face of misfortune and promote the pub­
lic good.
For many conservatives and right-wing extremists, a market-driven society
represents more than a tirade against “big government.” It constitutes a new kind
of politics that privileges exchange values and quick profits over all non-commod­
ified values, resists all forms of government intervention (except when it benefits
the rich and powerful and the defense industry), celebrates excessive individualism,
and consolidates the power ofthe rich along with powerful corporations-current­
ly coded as mammoth financial institutions such as the insurance companies, phar­
maceutical companies, and big banks. Moreover, the ability of this previously
devalued market-driven system to endlessly come back to life is truly astonishing.
How can the Dick Armeys of the world be featured in Tb: New York Times as if their
ideology and ruthlessness is worthy of a major news story? How is it that an end­
less number of ex and current politicians who are wedded at the hip to corporate
interests can be taken seriously as spokespersons for the larger public?
As the fog of social and historical amnesia rolls over the media and the coun­
try in general, it does so in spite of the financial tsunami unleashed in 2008, the
debacle following Hurricane Katrina, the Gulf oil crisis, and the in-your-face pay­
out of big bonuses by institutions that were bailed out by the government. Clearly,
market fundamentalism is alive and well in the United States, suggesting that it also
58 | SECTION IZ ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY
works hard through the related modalities of education and seduction to induce the
public to conform to the narrow dictates, values, and dreams of totalizing market
society, regardless of how disruptive it is of their lives. Shouting against the evils of
big government does little to register or make visible the power of big corporations
or a govemment that serves corporate rather than democratic needs. Even as an eco­
logical disaster looms along the Gulf Coast, there seems to be little analysis of how
then Vice President Dick Cheney secretly convened the oil companies in order to
set the standards for energy policy in the United States, setting the stage for even­
tual disasters such as the recent deep-sea oil leak in the Gulf that could have been
prevented with proper government oversight. Nor is there any public outrage of how
casino capitalism’s most treasured formula of short-term investments for quick
profits ignores the possibility of deadly social costs, especially regrettable as BP
devoted little time to creating contingent plans in the event that one of its offshore
oil wells failed, which, of course, it did. Such an investment would have cut into
quick profits, and now billions will be spent, most likely taxpayers’ money, to fix the
ecological and human damage done along one of the most beautiful coastlines in
America.
What is unique and particularly disturbing about this hyper-market-driven
notion of economics is that it makes undemocratic modes of education central to
its politics and employs a mode of pedagogy aimed at displacing and shutting
down all vestiges of the public sphere that cannot be commodified, privatized, and
commercialized. Consumers are in and citizens are out. Fear-mongering and lying
are the discourses of choice, while dialogue and thoughtfiilness are considered
weakness. To a greater extent than at any other point in liberal modemity, this regime
of Economic Darwinism now extends economic rationality “to formerly noneco­
nomic domains [shaping] individual conduct, or more precisely, [prescribing] the
citizen-subject of the neoliberal order."6 Most crucially, this struggle over the con­
struction ofthe market-driven consumer-subject, especially as it applies to young
people, is by and large waged outside of formal educational institutions, in peda­
gogical sites and spaces that are generally privatized and extend from the tradition­
al and new media to conservative-funded think tanks and private schools.7 As
corporate-controlled spheres and commodity markets assume a commanding role
educating young and old alike, pedagogy is redefined as a tool of commerce aggres­
sively promoting the commodification of young people and the destruction of
non-commodified public spaces and institutions. I-low else to explain that it is
almost impossible to read about educational reform in the dominant media except
as a tool to educate people for the workforce? In other words, education is a form
of commerce and nothing more. Education for democracy today sounds a lot like
the idea that health care for everyone is socialism. Clearly, what we are witnessing
MAR|<ET°DRlVEN HYSTERIA AND THE POLITICS OF DEATH I 69
here is not just the rise of political theater or media-driven spectacle in American
society but a populism that harbors a deep disdain for democracy and no longer
understands how to define itself outside of the imperatives of capital accumulation,
shopping, and the willingness to view more and more individuals and groups as sim­
ply disposable, waste products no longer worthy ofthe blessings of consumption.
As moral and ethical considerations are decoupled from the calculating logic
and consequences of all economic activity, the horrendous human toll in suffering
and hardship being visited upon all segments of the American population is lost in
the endless outburst of anger, if not hysteria, promoted by right-wing extremists
shouting for a return to the good old days when financial institutions and money
markets set policy, eventually ushering in one of the most serious economic crises
this country has ever faced. As the values of human solidarity, community, friend­
ship, and love are once again subordinated to the notion that only markets can give
people what they want, the culture of fear and cruelty grows in proportion to the
angry protests, the threat of violence, and the unapologetic racism aimed at the
Obama administration. In part, this is exemplified in not only the endless public
pronouncements that make a market society and democracy synonymous but also
in the ongoing celebration, in spite of the near collapse of the mortgage sector, of
the excesses ofthe new Gilded Age. Like those reanimated corpses that endlessly
return in such classic zombie films as Dawn #the Dead, right-wing Republicans and
Democrats are back shouting from every conceivable platform to demolish any ves­
tige of reform that relies on “big government.” The right-wing infatuation with the
word “death,” as in the fictitious claim about Obama’s death panels, is telling-more
a projection of their own politics than a serious critique of health care reform leg­
islation. Despite a change in U.S. political leadership, these forces, if left unchecked,
will continue to promote and fight for a transformation of democratic govemance
and citizenship until they are both completely destroyed.
As democracy is increasingly reduced to an empty shell and the rise of a cor­
porate and punishing state looms heavily on the twenty-first-century horizon, the
market-driven principles of deregulation, radical individualism, and privatization
penetrate all aspects of daily life. Such market-driven values and their accompany­
ing power-shaping institutions now profoundly influence the very nature of how
Americans think, act, and desire. All of which are increasingly wedded to the epi­
center of a grotesque consumer culture, whose underside is a heartless indifference
to the suffering and hardship of the millions of people without jobs, homes, child
care, and, increasingly, hope. The current fight against immigration and real edu­
cational reform is not really just about fixing a terribly iniquitous and broken sys­
tem. lt is a struggle against the prospect of a better future for young people, the poor,
the excluded, and those struggling to stay alive in America. What are we to make
70 | SECTION II ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY
of an ideology that moves from dismantling the welfare state to embracing the pun­
ishing state, an ideology that increasingly turns its back on those individuals for
whom the prisons are now deputized as the only welfare institutions left in America,
or, if they are lucky, who find themselves in one of the emerging tent cities found
under bridges and located in other invisible landscapewused in the past to get rid
of waste products, but now used to dump poor working-class and middle-class fam­
ilies.
Where is this hysteria going, given that we now have in office an administra­
tion that refuses to fight for the ideals it campaigned on? We get a glimpse of where
it is going in the tirades let loose recently by people like Sarah Palin, a dumber-than­
dumb version of Ayn Rand, and Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of
Minnesota who. when she is not calling for members of Congress to be investigat­
ed for their communist sympathies, is railing against Obama’s socialism. In lead­
ing crowds in Washington, DC, with the chant, “kill the bill,” Bachmann displayed
not simply an angry protest against health care reform. On the contrary, there is a
much broader notion of politics at stake here, one in which she and others are
protesting for an utterly privatized and commodified society where corporations and
markets define politics while matters of life and death are removed from ethical con­
siderations, increasingly subject to cost-benefit analyses and the calculations of
potential proiit margins. In this scenario, each individual is on his or her own in con­
fronting the many systemic problems facing American society, each of us respon­
sible for our own fate, even when facing systemic problems that cannot be solved
by isolated individuals. This politics of hysteria and ruthlessness that is now on hill
display in America is not just an attack on the social state, big govemment, the pub­
lic sphere, and the common good but on the very essence of politics and democra­
cy. This is truly a politics ofthe hyper-dead, a zombie politics that celebrates death
over life.

Torturing Children:
Bush’s Legacy and
Democracy's Failure
Salvos from the Culture of Cruelty
owhere is there a more disturbing, if not horrifying, example of the relation­
ship between a culture of cruelty and the zombie politics of irresponsibility
than in the resounding silence that surrounds the torture of children under the pres­
idency of George W. Bush-and the equal moral and political failure of the Obama
administration to address and rectify the conditions that made it possible. But if
we are to draw out the dark and hidden parameters of such crimes, they must be
made visible so men and women can once again refuse to orphan the law, justice,
and morality. How we deal with the issue of state terrorism and its complicity with
the torture of children will determine not merely the conditions under which we
are willing to live but whether we will live in a society in which moral responsibil­
ity disappears altogether and whether we will come to find ourselves living under
either a democratic or authoritarian social order. This is not merely a political and
ethical matter but also a matter of how we take seriously the task of educating our­
selves more critically in the fixture.
We haven’t always looked away. When Emmett Till’s battered, brutalized,
and broken 14-year-old body was open to public viewing in Chicago after he was
murdered in Mississippi in 1955, his mother refused to have him interred in a closed
casket. His mutilated and swollen head, his face disfigured and missing an eye, made
him unrecognizable as the young, handsome boy he once was. The torture, humil­
iation, and pain this innocent African American youth endured at the hands of
white racists was transformed into a sense of collective outrage and pain, and
74 | SECTION II ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY
helped launch the Civil Rights movement. Torture when inflicted on children
becomes indefensible. Even among those who believe that torture is a defensible
practice to extract information, the case for inflicting pain and abuse upon children
proves impossible to support. The image of young children being subjected to pro­
longed standing, handcuffed to the top of a cell door, doused with cold water,
raped, and shocked with electrodes boggles the mind. These corrupting, degener­
ate, and despicable practices reveal the utter moral depravity underlying the ratio­
nales used to defend torture as a viable war tactic.
There is an undeniable pathological outcome when the issue of national secu­
rity becomes more important than the survival of morality itself] resulting in some
cases in the deaths of thousands of children-and with little public outrage. For
instance, then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, appearing on the national tele­
vision program 60 Minutcs in 1996, was asked by Leslie Stahl for her reaction to
the killing of half a million Iraqi children in five years as a result of the U.S. block­
ade. Stahl pointedly asked her, “We have heard that a half million children have died.
I mean, that’s more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price
worth it?" Albright replied, “I think this is a very hard choice, but the price-we
think the price is worth it.”1 The comment was barely reported in the mainstream
media and produced no outrage among the American public. As Rahul Mahajan
points out, “The inference that Albright and the terrorists may have shared a com­
mon rationale-a belief that the deaths of thousands of innocents are a price worth
paying to achieve one’s political ends-does not seem to be one that can be made
in the U.S. mass media.”2
More recentlyg Michael Haas has argued that in spite of the ample evidence that
the United States has both detained and abused what may be hundreds of children
in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo, there has been almost no public debate
about the issue and precious few calls for prosecuting those responsible for the tor­
ture. He writes:
The mistreatment of children is something not so funny that has been neglected on the road
to investigations of and calls for prosecution of those responsible for torture. George W. Bush
has never been asked about the abuse of children in American-run prisons in the “war on
terror.” It is high time for Bush and others to be held accountable for what is arguably the
most egregious of all their war crimewthe abuse and death of children, who should never
have been anestcd in the first place. The best kept secret of Bush’s war crimes is that thou­
sands of children have been imprisoned, tortured, and otherwise denied rights under the
Geneva Conventions and related intemational agreements. Yet both Congress and the
media have strangely failed to identify the very existence of child prisoners as a war crime.3
While it is diHicult to confirm how many children have actually been detained, sex­
ually abused, and tortured by the Bush administration, there is ample evidence that
such practices have taken place not only from the accounts of numerous journal­
ToRTuR|Nc CH|LoREN: BusH's LEGACY AND DEMocRAcv's FA|LuRE | 75
ists but also in a number of legal reports. One of the most profoundly disturbing
and documented cases of the torture of a child in the custody of U.S. forces is that
of Mohammed jawad, who was captured in Afghanistan after he allegedly threw a
hand grenade at a military vehicle that injured an Afghan interpreter and two U.S.
soldiers. He was immediately arrested by the local Afghan police, who tortured him
and consequently elicited a confession from him. An Afghan Attorney General, in
a letter to the U.S. government, claimed that jawad was 12 years old when captured,
indicating that he was still in primary school, though other sources claim he was
around 15 or 16.4 ]awad denied the charges made against him by the Afghan
police, claiming that “they tortured me.They beat me. They beat me a lot. One per­
son told me, ‘If you don't confess, they are going to k.ill you.’ So, I told them any­
thing they wanted to hear.”5
On the basis of a confession obtained through torture, _Iawad was turned over
to U.S. forces and detained first at Bagram and later at Guantanamo. This child,
caught in the wild zone of permanent war and illegal legalities, has spent more than
six years as a detainee. Unfortunately, the Obama administration, even after admit­
ting that _Iawad had been tortured illegally; has asked the court to detain him so that
it can decide whether or not it Wal‘ltS to bring a criminal charge against him. After
a federal judge claimed the government’s case was “riddled with holes,” the Obama
administration decided it would no longer consider _Iawad a “military detainee but
would be held for possible prosecution in American civilian courts."6 This shame­
fill decision takes place against any sense of reason or modicum of morality and jus­
tice.
Even ]awad’s former military prosecutor, Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld, a Bronze
Star recipient, has stated that there “is no credible evidence or legal basis” to con­
tinue his detention and that he does not represent a risk to anyone.7 In an affidavit
filed with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he claimed “that at least
three other Afghans had been arrested for the crime and had subsequently confessed,
casting considerable doubt on the claim that Mr. ]awad was solely responsible for
the attack.”3 It gets worse: Vandeveld also pointed out that the confession obtained
by the Afghan police and used as the cornerstone of the Bush administrations case
against jawad could not have been written by him because “jawad was fiinctional­
ly illiterate and could not read or write [and ] the statement was not even in his
native language of Pashto.”9 The ACLU points out that “the written statement
[that] allegedly contain[s] Mohammed’s confession and thumbprint is in Farsi,”
which jawad does not read, write, or speak.1°
Vandeveld was so repulsed by the fact that all of the evidence used against _lawad
was forcibly obtained through torture that he “first demanded that jawad be
released, then, when Bush officials refused, unsuccessfully demanded to be relieved
76 | SECTION |: ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY
of his duty to prosecute and then finally resigned.”11 Since resigning, he is now a
key witness in ]awad’s defense and works actively with the ACLU to get him
released. As Bob Herbert has written, “There is no credible evidence against jawad,
and his torture-induced confession has rightly been ruled inadmissible by a mili­
taryjudge. But the administration does not feel that he has su&°ered enough.”12 And
yet _lawad was the subject of egregious and repugnant acts of torture from the
moment he was captured in Afghanistan and later turned over to American forces.
In a sworn affidavit, Colonel Vandeveld stated that _lawad had undergone
extensive abuse at Bagram for approximately two months: “The abuse included the
slapping of Mr. _Iawad across the face while Mr. ]awad’s head was covered with a
hood, as well as Mr. ]awad’s having been shoved down a stairwell while both hood­
ed and shackled.”13 As soon asjawad arrived at Bagram, the abuse began, with him
being forced to pose for nude photographs and undergo a stripsearch in front of a
number of witnesses. He was also blindfolded and hooded while interrogated and
“told . _ _ to hold on to a water bottle that he believed was actually a bomb that could
explode at any moment.”14In addition, while in the custody of U.S. forces, he was
subjected to severe abuse and torture. According to the ACLU:
U.S. personnel subjected Mohammed to beatings, forced him into so-called “stress positions,”
forcibly hooded him, placed him in physical and linguistic isolation, pushed him down stairs,
chained him to a wall for prolonged periods, and subjected him to threats including threats
to kill him, and other intimidation. U.S. forces also subjected Mohammed to sleep depri­
vation; interrogators' notes indicate that Mohammed was so disoliented at one point that
he did not know whether it was day or night. Mohammed was also intimidated, frightened
and deeply disturbed by the sounds of screams from other prisoners and rumours of other
prisoners being beaten to death.15
The specifics of the conditions at Bagram under which _Iawad was confined as a child
are spelled out in a military interrogator’s report:
While at the BCP (Bagram Collection Point) he described the isolation cell as a small room
on the second floor made of wood .... He stated that while he was held in the isolation cells,
they kept him restrained in handcuffs and a hood over his head, also making him drink lots
of water. He said the guards made him stand up and if he sat down, he would be
beaten .... [He] stated that he was made to stand to keep him from sleeping and said when
he sat down the guards would open the cell door, grab him by the throat and stand him up.
He said they would also kick him and make him fall over, as he was wearing leg shackles
and was unable to take large steps. He said the guards would fasten his handcuffs to the iso­
lation cell door so he would be unable to sit down .... [He] said due to being kicked and beat­
en at the BCR he experienced chest pains and difiiculty with urination.”
The interrogations, abuse, and isolation daily proved so debilitating physically and
mentally that jawad told military personnel at Bagram that he was contemplating
roRruR|NG CH|toREN: BusH's LEGACY AND t>EMoCRACv's FA1LuRE | 77
suicide. What must be kept in mind is that this victim of illegal abuse and torture
was only a juvenile, still in his teens and not even old enough to vote in the United
States. Unfortunately, the torture and abuse of this child continued as he was trans­
ferred to Guantanamo. Starved for three days before the trip, given only sips of
water, he arrived in Cuba on February 3, 2003, and was subjected to physical and
linguistic isolation for 30 days-the only human contact being with interrogators.
In October 2003, he underwent another 30-day period of solitary confinement. The
interrogators displayed a ruthlessness with this young boy that is hard to imagine,
all in the absence of legal counsel for jawad. For instance, “Military records from
throughout 2003 indicate that Mohammed repeatedly cried and asked for his
mother during interrogation. Upon information and belief; before one interroga­
tion, Mohammed fainted, complained of dizziness and stomach pain, but was
given an IV and forced to go through with the interrogation.”17 Driven to despair
over his treatment,]awad attempted suicide on December 25, 2003. Hints of such
despair had been observed by one interrogator, who approached a military psychol­
ogist and asked that the “techniques being applied to _lawad should be temporari­
ly halted because they were causing him to dissociate, to crack up without providing
good information.”13
These techniques were particularly severe and, as Meteor Blades points out, can
cause “physical deterioration, panic, rage, loss of appetite, lethargy, paranoia, hallu­
cinations, self-mutilation, cognitive dysfunction, disorientation and mental break­
downs, any of which, alone or in combination, can spur the detainee to give
interrogators more information than he might otherwise surrender.”l9 Not only did
Army Lieutenant Colonel Diane M. Zeirhoffer, a licensed psychologist, refuse to
stop the abuse, which she had ordered; she also-according to the testimony of
Lieutenant Colonel Vandeveld-engaged in a psychological assessment not to
“assist in identifying and treating any emotional or psychological disturbances Mr.
_lawad might have been suffering from. It was instead conducted to assist the inter­
rogators in extracting information from Mr. jawad, even exploiting his mental vul­
nerabilities to do so .... From my perspective, this officer had employed his or her
professional training and expertise in a profoundly unethical manner.”20
T his is an egregious example of how the war on ICITOI, its reign of illegal legal­
ities, and its supportive culture of cruelty transforms members of a profession who
take an oath to “do no harm” into military thugs who use their professional skills
in the service of CIA and military interrogations and detainee torture-even the
almost unspeakable torture of juveniles.The abuse of jawad, bordering on Gestapo­
like sadism, continued after his attempted suicide. From May 7-20, 2004, he was
subjected to what military interrogators called the “frequent flyer” program, which
was a systemic regime of sleep disruption and deprivation. ln order to disrupt his
sleep cycle, Jawad, according to military records, “was moved between two differ­
78 | SECTION II ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CULTURE OF CRUELTY
ent cells 112 times, on average every two hours and S0 minutes, day and night. Every
time he was moved, he was shackled.”21 As a result of this abuse, “Mohammed’s
medical records indicate that significant health effects he suffered during this time
include blood in his urine, bodily pain, and a weight loss of 10% from April 2004
to May 2004.”22 At a]une 2008 military commission hearing, ]awad’s U.S. military
lawyer inquired as to why “someone in a position of authority . _ and not just the
guards" was not being held accountable for _Iawad’s subjection to the “frequent
flyer” program.23 The govemment refused to supply any names or prosecute any­
one involved in the program, citing their right to privacy, as if such a right overrides
“allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punish­
ment and the right of victims of human rights violations to remedy.”24
The torture and abuse of the child detainee Mohammed ]awad continued up
to about June 2, 2008, when he was “beaten, kicked, and pepper-sprayed while he
was on the ground with his feet and hands in shackles, for allegedly not comply­
ing with guards' instructions. Fifteen days later, there were still visible marks con­
sistent with physical abuse on his body, including his arms, knees, shoulder, forehead,
and ribs.”25 How the Obama administration could possibly defend building a
criminal case against Mohammed jawad, given that he was under 18 years of age
at the time of his arrest and had endured endless years of torture and abuse at the
hands of the U.S. government, raises serious questions about the ethical and polit­
ical integrity of this government and its alleged commitment to human rights.
The case against this young man was so weak that _Iudge Ellen Segal Huvellc
has not only accused the government of “dragging [the case] out for no good rea­
son," but also expressed alarm at how weak the government’s case was, stating in a
refusal to give them an extension to amass new evidence against ]awad, “You’d bet­
ter go consult real quick with the powers that be, because this is a case that’s been
screaming at everybody for years. This case is an outrage to me .... I am not going
to sit up here and wait for you to come up with new evidence at this late hour ....
This case is in shambles.”26 On july 30, 2009,_Iudge Huvellc ordered the Obama
administ1'ation to release _lawad by late August. She stated, “After this horrible, long,
tortured history, I hope the government will succeed in getting' him back
home .... Enough has been imposed on this young man to date.”27 The New York
Times reported, in what can only be interpreted as another example of bad faith on
the part ofthe Obama administration, that the justice Department responded to
]udge Huvelle’s ruling by suggesting that “they were studying whether to file civil­
ian criminal charges against Mr. Jawad. If they do, officials say, he could be trans­
ferred to the United States to face charges, instead of being sent to Afghanistan,
where his lawyers say he would be released to his mother.”23 In August of 2009,
Mohammed Jawad was flown from Cuba to Afghanistan and released to his fam­
ily. The U.S. government claims the criminal investigation is still open, but the
roRTuR|N<; cH|LoReN: BusH's LEGACY Amo oEMocRAcv's F/muse | 79
chance of such an investigation taking place is now unlikely.
Even more disturbing are statements by ]awad’s defense lawyers claiming that
the witnesses who may be used in bringing a criminal case against _lawad were paid
by the government for their testimony. According to U.S. Marine Corps Major Eric
Montalvo, one of ]awad’s lawyers, all of the alleged witnesses “received some sort
of U.S. govemment compensation, from shoes and a trip to the United States to
$400 for cooperation, which is a princely sum in Afghanistan.”29 This type of
moral deception and sleazy illegality is straight from the playbook of high-level
Republican operatives in the Bush/Cheney administration. Moreover, this response
goes to the heart of the contradiction between Obama as an iconic symbol of a more
democratic and hopeful future and the reality of an administration that is capable
of reproducing some of the worst policies of the Bush administration.
]awad’s case is about more than legal incompetence. It is also about the descent
into the “dark side” of a zombie politics where a culture of cruelty reigns and the
rule of law is on the side of the most frightening of antidemocratic practices, point­
ing to a society in which terror becomes as totalizing as the loss of any sense of eth­
ical responsibility. Torture of this type, especially of a child, would appear to have
more in common with the techniques used by the Cvestapo, Pol Pot, the Pinochet
thugs in Chile, and the military junta in Argentina in the 1970s rather than with
the United States-or at least the democratic country the United States has histor­
ically claimed to be.

SECT|oN ll
Zombie Theater and the
Spectacle of llliteracy
The Spectacle of llliteracy
and the Crisis of
Democracy
Wright Mills argued fifty years ago that one important measure of the
¢demise of vibrant democracy and the corresponding impoverishment of
political life can be found in the increasing inability ofa society to translate private
troubles to broader public issues.l This is an issue that both characterizes and threat­
ens any viable notion of democracy in the United States in the current historical
moment. ln an alleged post-racist democracy, the image of the public sphere with
its appeal to dialogue and shared responsibility has given way to the spectacle of
unbridled intolerance, ignorance, seething private fears, unchecked anger, and the
decoupling of reason from freedom. Increasingly, as witnessed in the utter disre­
spect and not-so-latent racism expressed by]oe Wilson, the Republican congress­
man from South Carolina, who shouted “You lie!" during President Obama's
address on health care, the obligation to listen, respect the views of others, and
engage in a literate exchange is increasingly reduced to the highly spectacularized
embrace of an infantile emotionalism. This is an emotionalism that is made for tele­
vision. It is perfectly suited for emptying the language of public life of all substan­
tive content, reduced in the end to a playground for hawking commodities,
promoting celebrity culture, and enacting the spectacle of right-wing fantasies
fueled by the fear that the public sphere as an exclusive club for white male
Christians is in danger of collapsing. For some critics, those who carry guns to ral­
lies or claim Obama is a Muslim and not a bona fide citizen of the United States
84 | SECTION III ZOMBIE THEATER AND THE SPECTACLE OF ILLITERACY
are simply representative of an extremist fringe that gets far more publicity from the
mainstream media than they deserve. Of course this is understandable, given that
the media’s desire for balance and objective news is not just disengenuous but
relinquishes any sense of ethical responsibility by failing to make a distinction
between an informed argument and an unsubstantiated opinion. Witness the racist
hysteria unleashed by so many Americans and the media over the building of an
Islamic cultural center near Ground Zero.
The collapse of joumalistic standards fmds its counterpart in the rise of civic
illiteracy An African American president certainly makes the Rush Limbaughs of
the world even more irrational than they already are, just as the lunatic fringe
seems to be able to define itself only through a mode of thought whose first prin­
ciple is to disclaim logic itself But I think this dismissal is too easy. What this decline
in civility, the emergence of mob behavior, and the utter blurring in the media
between a truth and a lie suggest is that we have become one ofthe most il.literate
nations on the planet. I don’t mean illiterate in the sense of not being able to read,
though we have far too many people who are functionally illiterate in a so-called
advanced democracy, a point that writers such as Chris Hedges, Susan ]acoby, and
the late Richard Hofstadter made clear in their informative books on the rise of anti­
intellectualism in American life.2 I am talking about a different species of ignorance
and anti-intellectualism. llliterate in this instance refers to the inability on the part
of much of the American public to grasp private troubles and the meaning of the
selfin relation to larger public problems and social relations. It is a form of illiter­
acy that points less to the lack of technical skills and the absence of certain com­
petencies than to a deficit in the realms of politicwone that subverts both critical
thinking and the notion of literacy as both critical interpretation and the possibil­
ity of intervention in the world. This type of illiteracy is not only incapable of deal­
ing with complex and contested questions, it is also an excuse for glorifying the
principle of self-interest as a paradigm for understanding politics. This is a form of
illiteracy marked by the inability to see outside of the realm of the privatized self;
an illiteracy in which the act of translation Withers, reduced to a relic of another age.
The United States is a country that is increasingly defined by a civic deiicit, a chron­
ic and deadly form of civic illiteracy that points to the failure of both its education­
al system and the growing ability of anti-democratic forces to use the educational
force of the culture to promote the new illiteracy. As this widespread illiteracy has
come to dominate American culture, we have moved from a culture of questioning
to a culture of shouting and in doing so have restaged politics and power in both
unproductive and anti-democratic ways.
Think of the forces at work in the larger culture that work overtime to situate
us within a privatized world of fantasy, spectacle, and resentment that is entirely
THE SPECTACLE OF ILLITERACY AND THE CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY | 85
removed from larger social problems and public concerns. For instance, corporate
culture with its unrelenting commercials carpet-bombs our audio and visual fields
with the message that the only viable way to define ourselves is to shop and con­
sume in an orgy of private pursuits. Popular culture traps us in the privatized uni­
verse of celebrity culture, urging us to define ourselves through the often empty and
trivia.lized and highly individualized interests of celebrities. Pharmaceutical com­
panies urge us to deal with our problems, largely produced by economic and polit­
ical forces out of our control, by taking a drug, one that will both chill us out and
increase their profit margins. (This has now become an educational measure applied
increasingly and indiscriminately to children in our schools.) Pop psychologists urge
us to simply think positively give each other hugs, and pull ourselves up by the boot­
straps while also insisting that those who confront reality and its mix of complex
social issues are, as Chris Hedges points out, defeatists, a negative force that inhibits
“our inner essence and power.”3 There is also the culture of militarization, which per­
meates all aspects of our livewfrom our classrooms and the screen culture of real­
ity television to the barrage of violent video games and the blood letting in sports
such as popular wrestling~endlessly at work in developing modes of masculinity
that celebrate toughness, violence, cruelty, moral indifference, and misogyny.
All of these forces, whose educational influence should never be underestimat­
ed, constitute a new type of illiteracy, a kind of civic illiteracy in which it becomes
increasingly impossible to connect the everyday problems that people face with larg­
er social forces-thus depoliticizing their own sense of agency and making politics
itself an empty gesture. ls it any wonder that politics is now mediated through a
spectacle of anger, violence, htuniliation, and rage that mimics the likes of Tbejerry
Springer Show? It is not that we have become a society of the spectacle-though that
is partly true-but that we have fallen prey to a new kind of illiteracy in which the
distinction between illusion and reality is lost, just as the ability to experience our
feelings of discontent, and our fears of uncertainty are reduced to private troubles,
paralyzing us in a sea of resentment waiting to be manipulated by extremists
extending from religious fanatics to right-wing radio hosts. This is a prescription
for a kind of rage that looks for easy answers, demands a heightened emotional
release, and resents any attempts to think through the connection between our indi­
vidual woes and any number of larger social forces. A short list of such forces
would include an unchecked system of finance, the anti-democratic power of the
corporate state, the rise of multinationals and the destruction of the manufactur­
ing base, and the privatization of public schooling along with its devaluing of edu­
cation as a public good. As the public collapses into the personal, the personal
becomes “the only politics there is, the only politics with a tangible referent or emo­
tional valence,”4 the formative educational and political conditions that make a
86 | SECTION III ZOMBIE THEATER AND THE SPECTACLE OF ILLITERACY
democracy possible begin to disappear. Under such circumstances, the language of
the social is either devalued, pathologized, or ignored, and all dreams of the future
are now modeled around the narcissistic, privatized, and self-indulgent needs of con­
sumer and celebrity culture and the dictates of the allegedly free market. How else
to explain the rage against big government but barely a peep against the rule of big
corporations who increasingly control not only the government but almost every vital
aspect of our lives from health care to the quality of our environment?
Stripped of its ethical and political importance, the public has been largely
reduced to a space where private interests are displayed, and the social order increas­
ingly mimics a giant Dx Pbil show where notions of the public register as simply a
conglomeration of private woes, tasks, conversations, and problems. Most impor­
tantly, as the very idea of the social collapses into an utterly privatized discourse,
everyday politics is decoupled from its democratic moorings, and it becomes more
difficult for people to develop a vocabulary for understanding how private problems
and public issues constitute the very lifeblood of a vibrant politics and democracy
itself This is worth repeating. Emptied of any substantial content, democracy
appears imperiled as individuals are unable to translate their privately suffered mis­
ery into genuine public debate, social concerns, and collective action. This is a
form of illiteracy that is no longer marginal to American society but is increasing­
ly becoming one of its defining and more frightening features.
The raging narcissism that seems to shape every ad, film, television program,
and appeal now mediated through the power of the corporate state and consumer
society is not merely a clinical and individual problem. It is the basis for a new kind
of mass illiteracy that is endlessly reproduced through the venues of a number of
anti-democratic institutions and forces that eschew critical debate, self-reflection,
critical analysis, and certainly modes of dissent that call the totality of a society into
question. As American society becomes incapable of questioning itself the new illit­
eracy parades as just its opposite. We are told that education is about learning how
to take tests rather than learning how to think critically. We are told that anything
that does not make us feel good is not worth bothering with. We are told that char­
acter is the only measure of how to judge people who are the victims of larger social
forces that are mostly out of their control. When millions of people are unemployed,
tossed out of their homes, homeless, or living in poverty, the language of character,
pop psychology, consumerism, and celebrity culture are more than a diversion:
they are fundamental to the misdirected anger, mob rule, and illiteracy that frames
the screaming, racism, lack of civility, and often sheer and legitimate desperation.
Authoritarianism is often abetted by an inability of the public to grasp how
questions of power, politics, history, and public consciousness are mediated at the

ical sensibilities and conceive of ourselves as critical citizens, engaged public intel­
lectuals, and social agents. _lust as an obsession with the private is at odds with a pol­
itics informed by public consciousness, it also burdens politics by stripping it of the
kind of political imagination and collective hope necessary for a viable notion of
meaning, hope, and political agency.
Civic literacy is about more than enlarging the realm of critique and affirming
the social. It is also about public responsibility, the struggle over democratic public
life, and the importance of critical education in a democratic society The U.S. gov­
ernment is more than willing to invest billions in wars, lead the world in arms sales,
and give trillions in tax cuts to the ultra-rich but barely acknowledges the need to
invest in those educational and civic institutionwfrom schools to the arts to a mas­
sive jobs creation program-that enable individuals to be border crossers, capable
of connecting the private and the public as part of a more vibrant understanding of
politics, identity, agency, and governance. The new illiteracy is not the cause of our
problems, which are deeply rooted in larger social, economic, and political forces that
have marked the emergence of the corporate state, a deadly form of racism parad­
ing as color blindness, and a ruthless market fundamentalism since the 1970s, but
it is a precondition for locking individuals into a system in which they are complic­
itous in their own exploitation, disposability, and potential death.
The new illiteracy is about more than not knowing how to read the book or the
word; it is about not knowing how to read the world. The challenge it poses in a
democracy is one of both learning how to reclaim literacy so as to be able to nar­
rate oneself and the world from a position of agency. But it is also about unlearn­
ing those modes of learning that internalize modes of ignorance based on the
concerted refusal to know, be self-reflective, and act with principled dignity. It is a
problem as serious as any we have ever faced in the United States. At the core of
any viable democratic politics is the ability to question the assumptions central to
an imagined democracy. This is not merely a political issue but an educational issue,
one that points to the need for modes of civic education that provide the knowl­
edge and competencies for young and old alike to raise important questions about
what education and literacy itself should accomplish in a democracy.5 This is not
an issue we can ignore too much longer.

Zombie Politics andthe
Challenge of Right-Wing
Teaching Machines
Rethinking the Importance
ofthe Powell Memo
aul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, echoing the feelings of
many progressives, in 2009 wrote in The New York Times about how dismayed
he was over the success that right-wing ideologues had in undercutting Obama’s
health care bill-watering it down to a shadow of what it could have been before
it finally became law. He further indicated how unsettled he was by the ability of
conservatives to mobilize enormous public support against almost any reform
aimed at rolling back the economic, political, and social conditions that have cre­
ated the economic recession and the legacy of enormous suffering and hardship for
millions of Americans over the last thirty years.1 Krugman is somewhat astonished
that after almost three decades the political scene is still under the sway of what he
calls the “zombie doctrine of Reaganism"-the notion that any action by govern­
ment is bad, except when it benefits the military, corporations, and thc rich. Clearly,
for Knigman, zombie Reaganism appears once again to be shaping policies under
the Obama regime.
And yet, updated neoliberal Reaganism with its hatred of the social state, its
celebration of unbridled self-interest, its endless quest to privatize everything, and
its unflinching support for the deregulation of the economic system eventually
brought the country to economic near-collapse. lt also produced enormous suffer­
ing for those who never benefited from the excesses ofthe second Gilded Age, espe­
cially unemployed and underemployed workers, the poor, disadvantaged minorities,
and eventually large segments of the middle class. And yet zombie politics or casi­
90 | SECTION III ZOMBIE THEATER AND THE SPECTACLE OF ILLITERACY
no capitalism is back fighting efforts to strengthen bank regulations, resisting caps
on CEO bonuses, preventing climate control legislation, and refusing to limit mil­
itary spending. Unlike other pundits, Krugman does not merely puzzle over how
zombie politics can keep turning up on the political scene, a return not unlike the
endless corpses who keep coming back to life in George Romero's 1968 classic film,
Night #tba Living Dead (think of Bill Kristol, who seems to be wrong about every­
thing but just keeps coming back like a character in a Romero film). Krugman takes
the reader beyond mere puzzlement and argues that a wacky and allegedly discred­
ited right-wing politics is far from dead. In fact, Krugman argues that one of the
great challenges ofthe current moment is to try to understand the conditions that
have allowed it to once again shape American politics and culture, given the enor­
mous problems, including the current recession, it has produced at all levels of'
American society in the last thirty years.
Part of the explanation for the enduring quality of such a destructive politics
can be found in the lethal combination of money power, and education that the right
wing has had a stranglehold on since the early 1970s. Financial power plus an
insightful understanding of the importance of cultural politics has allowed conser­
vatives to use their influence to develop an institutional infrastructure and ideolog­
ical apparatus to produce their own intellectuals, disseminate ideas, and eventually
control most of the commanding heights and institutions in which knowledge is
produced, circulated, and legitimated. This is not simply a story about the rise of
mean-spirited buffoons such as Glerm Beck, Bill O’Reill}g and Michael Savage. Nor
is it simply a story about the loss of language, a growing anti-intellectualism in the
larger culture, or the spread of what some have called a new illiteracy endlessly being
produced in popular culture. As important as these tendencies are, there is some­
thing more at stake here that points to a combination of power, money, and edu­
cation in the service of creating an almost lethal restriction on what can be heard,
said, learned, and debated in the public sphere. And one starting point for under­
standing this problem is what has been called the Powell Memo-released on
August 23, 1971-authored by Lewis F. Powell, who would later be appointed to
the Supreme Court ofthe United States. Powell sent the memo to the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce with the title “Attack on the American Free Enterprise System.”
This memo is important because it reveals the power that conservatives attrib­
uted to the political nature of education and the significance this view had in shap­
ing the long-term strategy they put into place in the 1960s and 1970s to win an
ideological war against liberal intellectuals, who argued for holding government and
corporate power accountable as a precondition for extending and expanding the
promise of an inclusive democracy. The current concerted assault on government
and any other institutions not dominated by free-market principles represents the
ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CHALLENGE OF RIGHT-WING TEACHING MACHINES | 9]
high point of a fifty-year strategy that was first put into place by conservative ide­
ologues such as Frank Chodorov, the founder ofthe Intercollegiate Studies Institute;
publisher and author Wil.liam R Buckley; former Nixon Treasury Secretary William
Simon; and Michael ]oyce, the former head of both the Olin Foundation and the
Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. The Powell Memo is important because it
is the most succinct statement, if not the founding document, for establishing a the­
oretical framework and political blueprint for the current assault on any vestige of
democratic public life that does not subordinate itself to the logic of the allegedly
free market.
Initially, Powell identified the American college campus “as the single most
dynamic source” for producing and housing intellectuals “who are unsympathetic
to the [fiee] enterprise system.”2 He was particularly concerned about the lack of
conservatives in social sciences faculties and urged his supporters to use an appeal
to academic freedom as an opportunity to argue for “political balance” on univer­
sity campuses. Powell recognized that one crucial strategy in changing the politi­
cal composition of higher education was to convince university administrators and
boards of trustees that the most fundamental problem facing universities was “the
imbalance of many faculties.”3 Powell insisted that “the basic concepts of balance,
fairness and truth are difficult to resist, if properly presented to boards of trustees,
by writing and speaking, and by appeals to alumni associations and groups.”4 But
Powell was not only concerned about what he perceived as the need to enlist high­
er education as a bastion of conservative, free-market ideology.
The Powell Memo was designed to develop a broad-based strategy both to
counter dissent and develop a material and ideological infiastructure with the capa­
bility to transform the American public consciousness through a conservative ped­
agogical commitment to reproduce the knowledge, values, ideology, and social
relations of the corporate state. For Powell, the war against liberalism and a substan­
tive democracy was primarily a pedagogical and political struggle designed both to
win the hearts and minds of the general public and to build a power base capable
of eliminating those public spaces, spheres, and institutions that nourish and sus­
tain what Samuel Huntington would later call (in a 1975 study on the “governabil­
ity of democracies” by the Trilateral Commission) an “excess of democracy.”5
Central to such efforts was Powell’s insistence that conservatives nourish a new gen­
eration of scholars who would inhabit the university and function as public intel­
lectuals actively shaping the direction of policy issues. He also advocated the
creation of a conservative speaker’s bureau, staffed by scholars capable of evaluat­
ing “textbooks, especially in economics, political science and sociology.”6 In addi­
tion, he advocated organizing a corps of conservative public intellectuals who would
monitor the dominant media, publish their own scholarly journals, books, and
92 | SECTION III ZOMBIE THEATER AND THE SPECTACLE OF ILLITERACY
pamphlets, and invest in advertising campaigns to enlighten the American people
on conservative issues and policies.
The Powell Memo, while not the only influence, played an important role in
convincing a “cadre of ultraconservative and self-mythologizing millionaires bent
on rescuing the country from the hideous grasp of Satanic liberalism”7 to match their
ideological fervor with their pocketbooks by “disbursing the collective sum of
roughly $3 billion over a period of thirty years in order to build a network of pub­
lic intellectuals, think tanks, advocacy groups, foundations, media outlets, and pow­
erful lobbying interests.”8 As Dave _lohnson points out, the initial eH°ort was slow
but effective:
In 1973, in response to the Powell memo, _loseph Coors and Christian-right leader Paul
Weyrich founded the Heritage Foundation. Coors told Lee Edwards, historian of the
Heritage Foundation, that the Powell memo persuaded him that American business was
“ignoring a crisis." In response, Coors decided to help provide the seed fimding for the cre­
ation of what was to become the Heritage Foundation, giving $250,000. Subsequently, the
Olin Foundation, under the direction of its president, former Treasury Secretary William
Simon (author ofthe influential 1979 bookA Time jbr Truth), began funding similar orga­
nizations in concert with “the Four Sisters"-Richard Mellon Scaife's various foundations,
the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the Olin Foundation and the Smith Richardson
Foundation-along with Coors’s foundations, foundations associated with the Koch oil fam­
ily, and a group of large corporations.9
The most powerful members of this group were ]oseph Coors in Denver, Richard
Mellon Scaife in Pittsburgh, _lohn Olin in New York City, David and Charles
Koch in Wichita, the Smith Richardson family in North Carolina, and Harry
Bradley in Milwaukee-all of whom agreed to finance a number of right-wing think
tanks, which over the past thirty years have come to include the Lynde and Harry
Bradley Foundation, the Koch Foundation, the Castle Rock Foundation, and the
Sarah Scaife Foundation. This formidable alliance of far-right-wing foundations
deployed their resources in building and strategically linking “an impressive array
of almost 500 think tanks, centers, institutes and concerned citizens groups both
within and outside of the academy .... A small sampling of these entities includes
the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute, the
Manhattan Institute, the Hoover Institution, the Claremont Institute, the American
Council of Trustees and Alumni, [the] Middle East Forum, Accuracy in Media, and
the National Association of Scholars, as well as [David] Horowitz’s Center for the
Study of Popular Culture.”10
For several decades, right-wing extremists have labored to put into place an
ultra-conservative re-education machine-an apparatus for producing and dissem­
inating a public pedagogy in which everything tainted with the stamp of liberal ori­
gin and the word “public” would be contested and destroyed. Commenting on the
ZOMBIE POLITICS AND THE CHALLENGE OF RICHT'WING TEACHING MACHINES I 93
rise of this vast right-wing propaganda machine organized to promote the idea that
democracy needs less critical thought and more citizens whose only role is to con­
sume, well-ltnown author Lewis Lapham writes:
The quickening construction of Santa's workshops outside the walls ofgovemment and the
academy resulted in the increased production of pamphlets, histories, monographs, and back­
ground briefings intended to bring about the ruin ofthe liberal ideal in all its institutional­
ized fonns-the demonization of the liberal press, the disparagement of liberal sentiment,
the destruction of liberal education-and by the time Ronald Reagan arrived in triumph at
the White House in 1980 the assembly lines were operating at fiill capacity.”
Any attempt to understand and engage the current right-wing assault on all ves­
tiges of the social contract, the social state, and democracy itselfwill have to begin
with challenging this massive infrastructure, which functions as one of the most
powerful teaching machines we have seen in the United States, a teaching machine
that produces a culture that is increasingly poisonous and detrimental not just to lib­
eralism but to the formative culture that makes an aspiring democracy possible. The
presence of this ideological infrastructure extending from the media to other sites
of popular education suggests the need for a new kind of debate, one that is not lim­
ited to isolated issues such as health care, but is more broad based and fundamen­
tal, a debate about how power, inequality, and money constrict the educational,
economic, and political conditions that make democracy possible. The screaming
harpies and mindless anti-public “intellectuals” who dominate the media today are
not the problem: it is the conditions that give rise to the institutions that put them
in place, finance them, and drown out other voices. What must be clear is that this
threat to creating a critically informed citizenry is not merely about a crisis of com­
munication and language but also about the ways in which money and power cre­
ate the educational conditions that make a mockery out of debate while hijacking
any trace of democracy.

Town Hall Politics
as Zombie Theater
Rethinking the Importance
ofthe Public Sphere
The bitter debate that unfolded over Obama’s health care plan garnered a great deal
of media attention. The images were both familiar and disturbing-members of
Congress being shouted down, taunted, hanged in efligy, and in some instances
receiving death threats. In some cases, mob scenes produced violence and resulted
in a number of arrests. Increasingly, people were showing up with guns at these
meetings, revealing an intimate connection between an embrace of violence, pol­
itics, and a disturbing hatred of both the public sphere and the conditions for real
exchange, debate, and dialogue over important social issues. Rowdy, zombie-like
crowds, many of whom read from talking points made available to them by right­
wing groups and legitimated by conservative television pundits, embraced a poli­
tics reminiscent of the Brown Shirts, whose task in Germany in the 1930s was to
disrupt oppositional meetings, beat up opponents of the Nazi or Fascist Parties, and
intimidate those individuals and groups that criticized authoritarian ideology.
This is not meant to suggest that all of the protestors at these meetings were
members of extremist groups as much as it seeks to reveal the deep historical
affinity such mob tactics have with dangerous authoritarian tendencies, many of
which are irresponsibly sanctioned both by politicians such as Republican Senator
Tom Coburn and right-wing television hosts such as Glenn Beck and Sean
Hannityf Of course, what started out as random meetings soon became a coordi­
nated attempt to build an organized political machine, which has mushroomed into
what has been called the Tea Party movement? The United States is neither Nazi
96 | SECTION III ZOMBIE THEATER AND THE SPECTACLE OF ILLITERACY
Germany nor fascist Italy. What is important to recognize in light of these violent
tendencies in the culture is Hannah Arendt’s prescient warning that elements of
totalitarianism continue to be with us and that rather than being relegated to the
dustbin of history, the “still existing elements of totalitarianism would be more like­
ly to crystallize into new forms.”3 These tendencies have been around for the last
twenty years in the form of militarism, religious fundamentalism, a rabid Economic
Darwinism, and a growing violence against the poor, immigrants, dissenters, and
others marginalized because of their age, gender, race, ethnicity, and color.
What is new under the Obama regime is that the often hidden alliance between
corporate power and the forces of extremism is now both celebrated and highly vis­
ible in the culture. What is novel is that the production of symbolic violence and
the organized attempts to undermine the most basic principles of democracy are now
embraced, if not showcased, as a register of patriotism and fueled by talk-radio
extremists and the Rupert Murdoch media empire. For example, Fox News’ Glenn
Beck mixes his anti-govermnent diatribes with the language of radical militia
groups. Beck has warned President Obama that “The second American revolution
is being played out right now . . . what is ahead may loosen the bonds of society,”
and it may end with “a French Revolution.” Endlessly capitalizing upon fear and
insecurity, Beck warns his audience that “[I]f we don’t have some common sense,
we’re facing the destruction of our country _ _ . it’s coming.”4 Eric Boehlert gets it
right in claiming that what we are currently “witnessing is a militia rerun. Except
this time, thanks to the likes of Beck and Fox News, the unwanted repeat is being
broadcast nationwide.”5 Increasingly, politics is being emptied of any substance as
citizens are reduced to obedient recipients of power by both the dominant media
and by a number of politicians at the highest level of government. Shaming and
silencing those who are at odds with right-wing and corporate views ofthe world
have become a national pastime or, as the Fox News pundits would argue, just a mat­
ter of common sense.
Some have referred to these groups as mobs, but that distinction does not hold
since many of the protesters are being fed talking points and are well organized to
target very specific Democratic Congressional representatives and increasingly any
currently elected politician. Mob rule is often spontaneous, while these rowdy,
gun-toting, and increasingly violent groups are being organized and legitimated
through the money and power ofthe insurance industry, lobbying groups such as
FreedomWorks, anti-government politicians, racist fringe groups, and elements of
the white militia. Many of them echo the type of anti-government extremism
reminiscent of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma bomber. As Frank Rich points out,
Anyone who was cognizant during the McVeigh firestorm would recognize the old warn­
ing signs re-emerging from the mists of history. The Patriot movement. “The New World
Order,"with its shadowy conspiracies hatched by the Council on Foreign Relations and the
TOWN HALL POLITICS AS ZOMBIE THEATER | 97
Trilateral Commission .... White supremacists. Militias . _ _ [and what] the Southern
Poverty Law Center had found in its report last year: the unhinged and sometimes armed
anti-government right that was thought to have vaporized after its Oklahoma apotheosis is
making a comeback. And now it is finding common cause with some elements of the
diverse, far-flung and still inchoate Tea Party movement. All it takes is a few self-styled “patri­
ots” to sow havoc.6
This is a movement of older white Americans who are generally uninformed polit­
ically, eager to eliminate most government agencies, and harbor an acute disdain for
debate, thoughtfulness, and dialogue. There is a chilling similarity between their
hatred of government and McVeigh’s claim that “I reached the decision to go on
the offensive-to put a check on government abuse of power.”7 In other words, they
hate and even view as a pathology any vestige of democratic governance, politics,
and representation. They are part of a fringe element within the GOP that has
moved increasingly from the margins to the center of power.3 They have already
played a prominent role in electing Scott Brown from Massachusetts to the U.S.
Senate, enabled Rand Paul, a card-carrying Tea Party founder, to win the Kentucky
Republican senatorial primary, and successfully ran a number of candidates for pub­
lic office.
While the media have often focussed, if not cashed in, on the rowdiness of Tea
Party members, they have been represented largely as simply angry citizens with
another point of view, as opposed to being members of a deeply authoritarian cam­
paign to both disrupt Obama’s reform agenda and to gut and destroy those spaces
in American society where democracy can be nourished. Such attempts at balance
undermine serious reporting and are politically disingenuous. Such groups have to
be understood as being organized not merely for the production of symbolic and
real violence, but also as a growing extremist movement that promotes a wilful mis­
reading of the meaning of freedom, security, and human rights. What is crucial to
recognize is that the groups who were shouting out and disrupting health care meet­
ings are also the same people who Want to privatize and corporatize public school­
ing, eliminate all traces of the social state, and destroy all remnants of those public
spheres that promote critical literacy, civic courage, and non-commodiiied values
that give meaning to a democracy
These are the folks who encouraged members of the Florida legislature to pass
a law that outlawed historical interpretation in Florida public schools.9 These are
the same groups for whom any vestige of education that promotes critical agency,
self-representation, and promotes democracy is condemned-or worse, simply dis­
patched to the garbage can of educational practices. They are deeply xenophobic and
appear to support fully Arizona’s reactionary anti-immigrant bill. It is impossible
to understand what these groups represent unless they are seen as part of an author­
itarian tradition that has gained enormous strength in the last twenty years as part
98 | SECTION III ZOMBIE THEATER AND THE SPECTACLE OF ILLITERACY
of a broader effort to corporatize civil society, militarize everyday life, criminalize
the eH”ects of social problems, privatize public goods, eviscerate any viable notion
of the social, govern society through the laws ofthe marketplace, and destroy those
public spaces where norms and democratic values are produced and constantly
renewed.
Viewed primarily as either an economic investment or with unadulterated dis­
dain, the public sphere is being undermined as a central democratic space for fos­
tering the citizen-based processes of deliberation, debate, and dialogue. The
important notion that space can be used to cultivate citizenship is now trans­
formed by a new “common sense” that links it almost entirely to the production of
consumers or to a pathologized space that bears the imprint of immigrants and those
others now viewed with contempt by the nativism of right-wing groups and their
televised spokespersons. The inevitable correlate to this logic is that providing
space for democracy to grow is no longer a priority. As theorists such as _liirgen
Habermas and David Harvey have argued, the idea of critical citizenship cannot
flourish without the reality of public space.10 Put differently, “the space of citizen­
ship is as important as the idea of citizenship.
As a political category, space is crucial to any critical understanding of how
power circulates, how disciplinary practices are constructed, and how social control
is organized. Public space as a political category performs invaluable theoretical work
in connecting ideas to material struggles, theories to concrete practices, and polit­
ical operations to the concerns of everyday life. Without public space, it becomes
more difficult for individuals to imagine themselves as political agents or to under­
stand the necessity for developing a discourse capable of defending civic institutions.
Public space confirms the idea of individuals and groups having a public voice, thus
drawing a distinction between civic liberty and market liberty.
The demands of citizenship affirm the social as a political concept in opposi­
tion to its conceptualization as a strictly economic category. The sanctity ofthe tra­
ditional town hall or public square in American life is grounded in the crucial
recognition that citizenship has to be cultivated in non-commercialized spaces,
in.formed by non-commercial civic values. Such spaces mark both the importance
of the public and the need for spheres where dialogue, debate, and reason prevail
against the production of civic il.literacy, violence, and mob rule. Indeed, democra­
cy itself needs public spheres where critical education as a condition for democra­
cy can be renewed, where people can meet, and democratic identities, values, and
relations have the time “to grow and flourish.”12 The organized disruptions of
town meetings, coupled with a growing Tea Party movement that appears to har­
bor more hate than insight, should not cancel out but renew the historical impor­
tance of public spaces. Such spaces are crucial for nourishing civic discourses and
offering counter-movements to fight the current disappearance of democratic pub­
”11
TOWN HALL POLITICS AS ZOMBIE THEATER | 99
lic spheres as significant spaces in which powerful states, corporations, groups, and
individuals can be held directly accountable for the ethical and material effects of
their decisions.
The hostile town meetings we witnessed in 2009 and 2010 are symptomatic of
a growing authoritarianism in the United States, mobilized through an ongoing cul­
ture of fear and a form of patriotic correctness designed to bolster a rampant
nationalism and a selective popularism. One consequence of such a move is the
demise of the promise of a vibrant democracy and the corresponding impoverish­
ment of political life, increasingly manifested in the inability of a society to ques­
tion itself, engage in critical dialogue, and translate private problems into social
issues. This is a position that both characterizes and threatens any viable notion of
democracy in the United States in the current historical moment. In a post-9/ 11
world, the space of shared responsibility has given way to the space of private fears
and larger corporate interests. Politics is now mediated through a spectacle of mob
rule in which fear and violence become the only modalities through which to grasp
the meaning of the self and larger social relations. As the public collapses into high­
ly charged narratives of personal anger, reason is uncoupled from freedom and the
triumph of civic illiteracy, suggesting that irrational mob rule becomes “the only pol­
itics there is, the only politics with a tangible referent or emotional valence.”13
Stripped of its ethical and political importance, the public has been largely
reduced to a space where private interests are displayed, and the social order increas­
ingly mimics a giant reality TV show where notions of the public register as sim­
ply a conglomeration of private woes, violent outbursts, and an unchecked hatred
for dissent and dialogue. Most importantly, as everyday politics is decoupled from
its democratic moorings, it becomes more difficult for people to develop a vocab­
ulary for understanding how private problems and public issues constitute the very
lifeblood of a vibrant politics and democracy itself Emptied of any substantial con­
tent, democracy appears imperiled as individuals are unable to translate their pri­
vately suffered misery into public concerns and collective action.
As the social is devalued and public discourse and politics disappear, only to be
replaced by unruly mobs emboldened by right-wing celebrities and politicians “to
become part ofthe mob,” “shout out,” and “rattle” speakers, what emerges is not sim­
ply an ugly display of individuals and groups mobilized by lobbyist-run groups such
as FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity. On the contrary, more than health
care reform is under attack. What is truly under attack is any artifact of a democ­
ratic society that is at odds with a fiee-market fiindamentalism and the dominant
financial and economic interests that benefit from it.
Politics takes many forms, but central to it is the need for individuals, groups,
and social movements to be able to translate individual problems into public con­
cems, to have informed opinions, and to create spaces where power is held account­
|00 | SECTION III ZOMBIE THEATER AND THE SPECTACLE OF ILLITERACY
able. The town hall fiascos are important, but they are only symptomatic of a larg­
er assault against the social contract, the social state, public spheres, and democra­
tic governance. And when read in this context, the challenge presented by these
manufactured spectacles can be used to raise the level of the analysis and public con­
versation about the historical, economic, and political context which has nourished
them and what must be done to address the larger threat and problems they pose
to American democracy. Clearly, any response to such outbursts and threats posed
by the growing Tea Party movement must be seen as part of a broader eH`ort to
address the importance of critical education, civic literacy, social responsibility, as
well as the need to raise important questions about what education and civic liter­
acy should accomplish in a democracy and what might such a politics capable of tak­
ing up this challenge look like.

Reclaiming Public Values
in the Age of Casino
Capitalism
his is a difficult time in American history. Economic meltdowns, massive
unemployment, corporate-induced ecological disasters in the Gulf of Mexico,
and a growing disdain for liberal and progressive politics that has gained enormous
currency since the election of Barack Obama to the presidency. The American peo­
ple have every right to demand to live in peace, enjoy the comforts of economic
security, have access to decent health care, be able to send their children to quali­
ty schools, and live with a measure of security Yet at a time when public values are
subordinated to the rationality of profits, exchange values, and unbridled self­
interest, politics becomes corrupt, devoid of critical agents, and reduced to empty
rituals largely orchestrated by those who control the wealth, income, media, and
commanding institutions of American society. As we have just witnessed in the
debate on health care reform, the interests of the vast majority of American peo­
ple in a public option and the extension of Medicare have been totally lost on a
Congress that has been corrupted by power and its comfortable and shameful
relations with those who control the military-industrial-academic complex. The
Republican Party minority in the Senate did everything they could to prevent the
further lengthening of a six-month extension of emergency jobless benefits for the
millions of long-term unemployed Americans, many of whom are barely able to sur­
vive and have given up all hope. Such tactics once again proving that at the core of
their policies is a desire to sap every element of life out of any viable notion of the
social state.
102 | SECTION III ZOMBIE THEATER AND THE SPECTACLE OF ILLITERACY
Public values, public spheres, and the notion of the common good are viewed
by too many politicians as either a hindrance to the goals of a market-driven soci­
ety, or they are simply treated as a burden on the society, viewed as a sign of weak­
ness, if not a pathology. Ethical considerations and social responsibility are now
devalued, ifnot disdained, in a society wedded to short-tenn investments, easy prof­
its, and a mode of economics in which social costs are increasingly borne by the poor
while financial and political benefits are reaped by the rich. Unchecked self`-inter­
est and ruthless, if not trivial, modes of competition now replace politics or at least
become the foundation for politics as complex issues are reduced to firiend/ enemy,
winner/loser dichotomies. The crass Social Darwinism played out on realityTV now
finds its counterpart in the politics of both the Democratic and Republican Parties.
For instance, the Republican Party’s only identifying ideology is that it is against
anything that supports the common good and undercuts the profits of corporations
and the rich. At the same time, Democrats have given up any vestige of a progres­
sive politics and vision, aligning their ideals to conform to the interests of the lob­
byists who now represent the not-so-invisible shadow government.1
Instead of public spheres that promote dialogue, debate, and arguments with
supporting evidence, we have a national entertainment state with its multiple pub­
lic and private spheres that infantilizes almost everything it touches, while offering
opinions that utterly disregard evidence, truth, and civility.2 Politics has come
under the sway of multiple forms of fimdamentalism, becoming more militarized,
privatized, and divorced from any notion of the common good or public welfare.
Violence saturates the culture, a brutalizing masculinity fuels the militarization of
everyday life, and a collective ignorance is fueled by the assumption that intelligence
and thoughtfulness should be dismissed as a form of elitism. Populism, or at least
the Sarah Palin version, has little resemblance to genuine resistance to the anti­
democratic tendencies in American society and now plays out as a homage to illit­
eracy and stupidity. Screen culture in its many manifestations signals if not celebrates
the collapse of politics and the coming apocalypse. Making the world a better
place has given way to collective narratives about how to survive alone in a world
whose destruction is just a matter of time. Death, fear, and insecurity trump cru­
cial questions about what it means to apprehend the conditions to live a good life
in common with others. Not only is the issue of the good life and the conditions
that make it possible often lost in the babble of the infotainment state, but the mar­
ket values that produced the economic crisis have so devalued the concept and prac­
tice of democracy that Americans find it hard to even define its meaning outside
of the sham of money-driven elections and the freedom to shop.
ln the last decade, the representative functions of democracy have not only taken
a steep dive in light of a political system whose policies are shaped by powerful cor­
porations and the imperatives of the rich but also made largely dysfunctional
RECLAIMINC PUBLIC VALUES IN THE ACE OF CASINO cAP|TAusM | 103
because of a morally and politically bankrupt electoral system intimately tied to
wealth and power. The dominant media largely function as a form of moral anes­
thesia and political firewall that legitimates a ruthless and failed free-market sys­
tem while refiising to make visible the workings of a casino capitalism that rejects
as a weakness any measure of compassion, care, trust, and vulnerability. As the val­
ues and interests ofthe market become a template for all of society, the only insti­
tutions, social relations, public spheres, and modes of agency that matter are those
that pay homage to the rule of mobile capital and the interests of financial titans.
What the current financial crisis has revealed has less to do with the so-called
greed of Wall Street moguls than with the increasing fragility of a market-driven
system that produces inequalities in every sphere of life, making its ode to democ­
racy and the good life a a dishonest fiction. Moreover, the formative culture that
legitimates market liindamentalism and market democracy does more than erase any
trace of self-regulation and public accountability; it also eliminates the language of
self-reflection along with any form of productive discourse about the common
good, public welfare, and the conditions that make all life worth living. Market-dri­
ven culture rejects the assumption that freedom is a shared experience in which self­
interest is subordinated to the affirmation of public values, the common good, and
the notion of social responsibility implied in recognizing and transforming the con­
ditions that make the lives of others precarious. As Judith Butler masterfully puts
lf!
Precariousness implies living socially, that is, the fact that one’s life is always in some sense
in the hands of the other. lt implies exposure both to those we know and to those we do not
know; a dependency on people we know, or barely know, or know not at all. Rcciprocally, it
implies being impinged upon by the exposure and dependency of others, most of whom
remain anonymous. These are not necessarily relations of love or even of care, but consti­
tute obligations toward others, most of whom we cannot name and do not know, and who
may or may not bear traits of familiarity to an established sense of who “we” are. ln the inter­
est of speaking in common parlance, we could say that “we” have such obligations to “oth­
ers” and presume that we know who “we” are in such an instance. 'l`he social implication of
this view, however, is precisely that the “we” does not, and cannot, recognize itself; that it is
riven from the start, intemipted by alterity, as Levinas has said, and the obligations “we” have
are precisely those that disrupt any established notion of thc “we."3
We have lived through a decade in which the call for security has lost any semblance
of truth and political necessity and has become the legitimating code for imposing
on the American people an imperial presidency-especially under George W. Bush
and increasingly under Obama-undermined crucial civil liberties, and expanded
the violence and terrorism associated with a permanent war economy and culture.
Democracy thrives on dissent, but dissent and critical citizenship cannot take place
in a country marked by a widening gap between political democracy and socio-eco­
104 | SECTION ||: ZOMBTE THEATER AND THE SPECTACLE OF |LuTERAcv
nomic power. Inequality is not just a normal outgrowth of a market-driven econ­
omy; it is fundamental to a political system that destroys democracy. A country that
allows the power of multi-national corporations to be exempt from rule of demo­
cratic law and the responsible demands of a democracy has already lost the battle
between balancing civil liberties and national security Any call for further giving
up of civil liberties suggests a dangerous silence about the degree to which civil lib­
erties are already at risk and how the current call for national safety might work to
fiirther a different type of terrorism, one not marked by bombs and explosions, but
by state-supported repression, the elimination of dissent, and the death of both the
reality and promise of democracy.
At this time of national crisis, we need to recognize that the current econom­
ic recession cannot be understood apart from the crisis of democracy itself lt is all
the more crucial, therefore, to recognize in a post~Gi1ded Age moment that those
public spaces that traditionally have offered forums for debating norms, critically
engaging ideas, making private issues public, and evaluating judgments are disap­
pearing under the juggernaut of free-market values, corporate power, and intense
lobbying pressure on the part of the country’s most powerful financial institutions.
Schools, universities, the media, and other aspects of the cultural education appa­
ratus are being increasingly privatized or corporatized and removed from the dis­
course of the public good. Consequently, it becomes all the more crucial for
educators, parents, social movements, and others to raise fundamental questions
about what it means to revitalize a politics and ethics that takes seriously “such val­
ues as citizen participation, the public good, political obligation, social governance,
and community.”
The call for a revitalized politics grounded in an effective democracy substan­
tively challenges the dystopian practices of the new culture of fear and neoliberal­
ism-with their all-consuming emphasis on insecurity, market relations,
commercialization, privatization, and the creation of a world-wide economy of
part-time workers-against their utopian promises. Such an intervention con­
fronts Americans with the problem as well as challenge of developing those pub­
lic spheres-such as the media, higher education, and other cultural
institutions-that provide the conditions for creating citizens who are capable of
exercising their freedoms, competent to question the basic assumptions that gov­
ern political life, and skilled enough to participate in developing broad social move­
ments that will enable them to shape the basic social, political, and economic
orders that govem their lives.
In spite of the fact that some notions of the public good have been recalled from
exile in light of the economic recession and the election of Barack Obama, many
young people and adults today still view the private as the only space in which to
imagine any sense of hope, pleasure, or possibility. Not only is hope disappearing
RECLAIMINC PUBLIC VALUES IN THE AGE or CASINO CAP|TAL1SM | |05
for this generation-which has been asked to give more but ask for less-but the
economic and educational conditions that enable any sense of possibility for this
generation are quickly disappearing. And while Obama and his priests of high
finance have spent billions to bail out banks and conduct foreign wars, they have
refiised to implement an adequate jobs-creation program for young people and the
millions of unemployed.
Market forces continue to focus on the related issues of consumption, exces­
sive profits, and fear. Reduced to the act of consuming, citizenship is “mostly about
forgetting, not learning,”5 in spite ofthe hyped-up and increasing appeal to bear­
ing the burden collectively of hard times-a burden that always falls on the shoul­
ders of working people but not the banks or other commanding financial
institutions. How else to explain the 2010 record profits of big banks and invest­
ment houses in the midst of an unflinching recession while millions lose their
homes, jobs, and dignity? Moreover, as social visions of equity and justice recede
from public memory, unfettered, brutal self-interests combine with retrograde
social policies to make security and safety a top domestic priority. One conse­
quence is that all levels of government are being hollowed out, reducing their role
to dismantling the gains of the welfare state as they increasingly construct policies
that now criminalize social problems, sell off public goods to the highest corporate
bidders, and prioritize penal methods over social investments. Increasingly, notions
of the public cease to resonate as a site of utopian possibility, as a fundamental space
for how we reactivate our political sensibilities and conceive of ourselves as critical
citizens, engaged public intellectuals, and social agents.
The growing lack of justice in American society rises in proportion to the lack
of political imagination and collective hope.6 We live at a time when the forces and
advocates of a market-driven fundamentalism and militarism not only undermine
all attempts to revive the culture of politics as an ethical response to the demise of
democratic public life but also aggressively wage a war against the very possibility
of creating non-commodified public spheres and forums that provide the conditions
for critical education, link learning to social change, political agency to the defense
of public goods, and intellectual courage to the refusal to surrender knowledge to
the highest bidder. Understood as both a set of economic policies and an impover­
ished notion of citizenship, neoliberalism represents not just a series of market-dri­
ven programs but also a coherent set of cultural, political, and educational practices
that mobilize communities around shared fears and collective insecurities.
Unlike some theorists who suggest that politics as a site of contestation, criti­
cal exchange, and engagement has either come to an end or is in a state of termi­
nal arrest in light of the current calls for patriotic unity, I believe that the current
depressing state of politics points to the urgent challenge of reformulating the cri­
sis of democracy as part of a fiindamental crisis of vision, meaning, education, and
|06 | SECTION III ZOMBIE THEATER AND THE SPECTACLE OF ILLITERACY
political agency Politics devoid of a democratic vision either degenerates into cyn­
icism or appropriates a view of power that appears to be equated only with domi­
nation. Lost from such accounts is the recognition that democracy has to be
struggled over-even in the face of a most appalling crisis of political agency and
threats to national security. There is also little attention paid to the fact that the
struggle over politics and democracy is inextricably linked to creating public spheres
where individuals can be educated as political agents equipped with the skills,
capacities, and knowledge they need not only to actually perform as autonomous
political agents but also to believe that such struggles are worth taking up. Central
here is the assumption that politics is not simply about power but also, as the
philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis points out, “has to do with political judgments
and value choices,”7 indicating that questions of civic education-learning how to
become a skilled citizen-are central to both the struggle over political agency and
democracy itself Finally, there is the widespread refusal among many Americans
and educators to recognize that the issue of civic education-with its emphasis on
critical thinking, bridging the gap between learning and everyday life, understand­
ing the connection between power and knowledge, and using the resources of his­
tory to extend democratic rights and identities-is not only the foundation for
expanding and enabling political agency but that such education takes place across
a wide variety of public spheres through the very force of culture itself
Any democratically inspired understanding of politics must challenge a casino
politics that fills the social order and the sphere of politics with the walking dead.
While the conditions for challenging casino politics may be under assault in what
might be called a progressive administration, the basis for expanding and deepen­
ing democracy must be part of an ongoing struggle of engaged critique, civic
courage, and organized collective struggles. Critical knowledge grounded in press­
ing social problems offers individuals and groups an important resource for shap­
ing the conditions that bear down on their lives, enabling them to resist those forces
that want to narrow the meaning of political freedom and social citizenship. The
production of such knowledge must be connected to the urgent call to revitalize the
language of civic education and ethical imagination as part of a broader discourse
of political agency and critical citizenship in a global world.
Reclaiming the connection between the political and the ethical imagination
as a pedagogical act may be one of the most crucial challenges facing the American
public in the twenty-first century If the institutions and conditions for a critical for­
mative culture of questioning and civic engagement necessary for think.ing beyond
the narrow framing mechanisms of casino capitalism, militarism, and religious
fundamentalism do not come into play, it is conceivable that the current econom­
ic recession will be repeated within a few short years, and American society will slip
into a form of authoritarianism that will give up even its most dubious claims on
RECLAIMINC PUBLIC VALUES IN THE ACE OF CASINO CAPITALISM I 107
democracy. The current crisis has systemic and ideological origins, and both must
be addressed through a new political language in which ethical imagination cou­
ples with a sense of educated hope and the need for collective agents willing to build
alternative public spheres and viable critical social movements.
We currently live in a society controlled by political and economic zombies.
Under such circumstances, the coupling of cynicism and multiple forms of illiter­
acy undermines the possibility of critical thought, agency, and action. Public val­
ues or the public good, when they are invoked, are often couched in a nostalgic
discourse about the New Deal or the Great Society Rather than being viewed as a
legacy that needs to be reclaimed, re-imagined, and renewed, visions of the public
good and the public values they embody are sequestered to the historical past, put
on display like a museum piece that is worth viewing but not an ideal worth strug­
gling over. Corporate domination, power, abuse, and greed are once again being
legitimated and argued for by a variety of right-wing movements in the United
States, the most visible being the Tea Party movement. These movements do more
than preach about God, money, and guns; they also sabotage democracy, block pub­
lic debate about alternative forms of power, and try to sell the illusion, as Chris
Hedges points out, “that the free market [is] a natural outgrowth of democracy and
a force of nature” that we simply have to accept unquestionably.8 Without an
urgent reconsideration ofthe crucial place of public values in shaping American soci­
ety, the meaning and gains of the past that extend fiom the Civil Rights movement
to the antiwar movements of the 1960s will be lost, offering neither models nor
examples of struggles forged in the heat of reclaiming democratic values, relations,
and institutions.
New York Times columnist Frank Rich has argued that the most striking char­
acteristic ofthe last decade is how much the American people have been conned,
played for suckers with arguments about weapons of mass destruction, the genius
of Karl Rove, and the importance of corporations in shaping our lives, to name a
few of the lies.9 Actually, as insightful as Rich is, he gets it backward. His claim that
the American public has been fed a massive diet of illusions enabling a big con over­
looks the power these ideas or deliberately shaped cons have as part of an official
and legitimating ideology. These ideas are not illusions; they are the symbolic
extensions of real and systemic power relations, and the often commonsense views
they promote are powerful modes of legitimation. The issue that needs to be
addressed is not simply about recognizing illusions but dismantling the socio-eco­
nomic-educational forces that produce and circulate them as part of a larger liam­
ing of distinct and systemic power relations. If we are to reclaim any viable notion
of the political along with the public values that give it meaning, we must address
the primacy of pedagogy and critical inquiry as part of a broader attempt to revi­
talize the conditions for individual and social agency, while simultaneously address­
108 | SECTION III ZOMBIE THEATER AND THE SPECTACLE OF ILLITERACY
ing the most basic problems facing the prospects for social justice and global
democracy. Public values matter, and they must become part of any ongoing attempt
to give meaning to politics, the ethical imagination, and the promise of an aspir­
ing democracy.

SEcT|oN III
Brutalizing Youth in the
Age of Zombie Politics
No Bailouts for Youth
Broken Promises and Dashed Hopes
y almost any political, economic, and ethical measure, Barack Obama’s elec­
tion victory in 2008 inherited a set of problems produced by one of the dark­
est periods in American history.1 In the eight years prior to 0bama’s presidency
not only did the spaces where genuine politics could occur largely disappear as a
result of an ongoing assault by the market-driven forces of privatization, deregu­
lation, and unrestrained corporate power, but there was also a radical hardening of
the culture that increasingly disparaged democratic values, the public good, and
human dignity-and with these the safety nets provided by a once-robust but now
exiled social state. George W. Bush, the privileged and profligate son of a wealthy
Texas oilman, became the embodiment of a political era in which willful immatu­
rity and stubborn civic illiteracy found its match in an emerging culture of excess
and irresponsibilit-y.2 As thc age of casino capital reigned supreme over American
society, the ongoing work of democratization-along with the public spheres need­
ed to sustain it-became an increasingly fragile, perhaps even dysfunctional, pro­
ject. Market principles now reached far beyond the realm of the economic and
played a formative role in influencing and organizing every domain of human activ­
ity and interaction, while simultaneously launching a frontal attack on notions of
a common good, public purpose, non-commodified values, and democratic modes
of governing.
Yet even in the aftermath of the October 2008 global financial crisis and the
112 | SECTION IIII BRUTALIZINC YOUTH IN THE AGE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
historic election of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States, the
vocabulary and influence of corporate power and hapless governance can still be
heard as the expansion of market fundamentalism continues, albeit more slowly,
along the trajectory of privileging corporate interests over the needs of the public
good, ignoring the rising demands of millions of people struggling for economic,
racial, and political justice. Tragically, the Obama administration seems complicit
with what has become an element of common sense for a large and noisy segment
of the populace-that the market, rather than politics, gives people what they
want. President Obama does not talk about a much-needed jobs-creation program
to address the massive hardships and suffering many people are experiencing.
Instead, he gets his cues from Wall Street and now focuses on taming the budget
deficit.3 Nor does he talk about the crippling poverty, collapsing urban infrastruc­
tures, or the general despair that now grips the country This state of affairs suggests
not only a perilous future for the social state and a government willing to intervene
on behalf of its citizens but also a dangerous view of govemance in which econom­
ic priorities dominate and suppress important social needs rather than being care­
fully adjusted toward the goal of fostering a more just, more democratic society.
It appears ever more unlikely that the Obama administration will undo the
havoc wrought by the Bush administration (itself the culmination of a decades-long
trend toward market deregulation) or reverse the effects of a rampant free-market
fixndamentalism now unleashed across the globe. As the financial crisis looms large
in the lives ofthe majority of Americans, government Hinds are used to bail out Wall
Street bankers rather than being used to address either the growing impoverishment
of the many people who have lost homes, jobs, and hope of a better future or the
structural conditions that created such problems. In this scenario, a privileged
minority retains the freedom to purchase time, goods, services, and security, while
the vast majority of people are relegated to a life without protections, benefits, and
safety supports. For those populations considered expendable, redundant, and invis­
ible by virtue of their race, class, and age, life becomes increasingly precarious.
As I have mentioned throughout this book, youth, in particular, are assaulted
by market forces that commodify almost every aspect of their lives, though differ­
ent groups of young people bear unequally the burden of this market-driven assault.
Those who are marginalized by class and power suffer more than the indignity of
being endlessly commodified and commercially carpet-bombed. They are also
objects of a low-intensity war that now criminalizes their behavior, subjects increas­
ing aspects of their lives to harsh disciplinary practices, and treats them as both dan­
gerous and disposable. In a society in which the social state that has been hollowed
out and largely stripped of its welfare functions, youth are no longer provided with
the economic, social, and cultural supports that offer them dignity, prosperity, and
the promise of a better fiiture. Instead, they are now largely governed by a corpo­
NO BA|LouTs FOR YOUTH | I I3
rate state that “secures power through the imposition of law, discipline and uncom­
promising modes of punishment and imprisonment."
As the mechanisms of power, containment, and policing merge, the spaces that
young people inhabit become increasingly militarized. At the same time such
hyper-militarized spaces, extending from the street to the school, are abetted by a
cultural apparatus and public pedagogy that jump at every opportunity to demean
and demonize young people, especially poor minority youth, by representing them
as an ever-present threat to society. In this instance, it becomes all too easy for the
American public to move from the notion of young people being troubled to view­
ing them as trouble, as a threat to be contained. Newspapers and other popular
media treat their audiences to an endless stream of alarming images and dehuman­
izing stories about rampaging young people who allegedly occupy a domestic war
zone. Youth are no longer categorized as Generation X, Y, or Z. Cn the contrary,
they are now defined rhetorically in mainstream media as “Generation Kill,” “Killer
Children,” or, as one CNN special labeled them, “Killers in Our Midst.”5
Capitalizing on shocking and sensational imagery not only swells the media’s bot­
tom line; it also adds fuel to a youth panic that insidiously portrays young people
as pint-size nihilists and an ever-present threat to public order. Such negative and
demeaning views have had disastrous consequences for young people as their lives
are increasingly subjected to policies and modes of governance defined through the
logic of punishment, surveillance, and penal control. Moreover, under the reign of
an expanding punishing state, coupled with the persistent structural racism ofthe
criminal justice system, the situation for a growing number of impoverished young
people and youth of color is getting much worse.
These are young people whose labor is unneeded, who are locked out of the
commodity market, and who often inhabit the impoverished and soul-crushing mar­
gins of society. Too often they fall prey to the dictates of a youth-crime-goveming
complex that increasingly subjects them to harsh disciplinary controls while crim­
inalizing more and more aspects of their behavior. How else to explain that on any
given day “one in every 10 young male high school dropouts is in jail or juvenile
detention?”° What kind of sense does it make to pass truancy laws in which a stu­
dent, even when he has a school pass that allows him to be out of classes early, is
stopped by the police and issued a $5 70 ticket for truancy?7 How can we reconcile
the rise of zero tolerance laws in schools with the presumption that schools should
be places where young people can feel safe and receive an education that prepares
them to be thoughtfiil, critical, and socially responsible citizens when such laws
impose harsh penalties for often trivial infractions, increase rates of suspension and
expulsion, disproportionately target African American youth, push poor young
people out of school and often into the criminal justice system? According to the
Advancement Project,
'I 14 | SECTION IIIZ BRUTALIZINC YOUTH IN THE ACE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
Zero tolerance has engendered a number of problems: denial of education through increased
suspension and expulsion rates, referrals to inadequate altemative schools, lower test scores,
higher dropout rates, and racial profiling of students .... Once many of these youths are in
“the system," they never get back on the academic track. Sometimes, schools refuse to read­
mit them; and even if these students do return to school, they are often labeled and target­
ed for close monitoring by school staff and police. Consequently, many become demoralized,
drop out, and fall deeper and deeper into the juvenile or criminaljustice systems. Those who
do not drop out may find that their discipline and juvenile or criminal records haunt them
when they apply to college or for a scholarship or government grant, or try to enlist in the
military or find employment. In some places, a criminal record may prevent them or their
families from residing in publicly subsidized housing. In this era of zero tolerance, the con­
sequences of ch.ild or adolescent behaviors may long outlive students' teenage years.8
Where is the collective anger over the use of disciplinary policies that share a
shameful and close aHinity to the legacy of segregated education, slavery, racial tar­
geting, the harsh and ruthless criminalization of poor white and minority youth, and
pedagogies of punishment, all of which push young people out of school and into
the criminal justice system? In this instance, schools neither educate nor provide even
minimal training for the workplace. Instead, they simply mimic traditional lockdown
institutions such as the prison and display a disdain for youth that offers no apolo­
gies because politicians, school boards, administrators, and some teachers have
become too arrogant and ruthless to imagine any resistance. Wedded to the blood­
less values of a market-driven society deeply implicated in reproducing the struc­
tures of racism, inequality, and exclusion, schools now inhabit a “dead zone” that
banishes civic pedagogy, the arts, and diH`erent critical modes of intelligibility.
Schools now do everything they can to deaden the imagination by defining and
framing classroom experiences through a lethal mix of instrumental values, cost-ben­
efit analyses, test-based accountability schemes, and high-stakes testing regimes.
These instrumentally- and market-based values and practices drown out, if not
repress, those spaces and pedagogical practices that provide the conditions for stu­
dents to think critically, value their own voices, mobilize their curiosity, engage in
shared learning, and-most of all-acquire the knowledge, habits, public values, and
social relations necessary for the practice of empowerment necessary for fostering
a real democracy and taking responsibility for sustaining it. More and more, it
appears that as schools become more militarized and subject to the latest technolo­
gies of regulation, surveillance, and control, they are transformed into laboratories
in which the limits of new authoritarian tendencies endemic to a corporate/pun­
ishing society are tamed, attenuated, and tested.9
Where is the moral outrage over a nation that incarcerates one in one hundred
adults in its local, state, and federal prisons and ails, fiagmenting families, desolat­
ing communities, and ruining the lives of millions of children?10 Where are the
intellectuals, parents, teachers, and social movements expressing political indigna­
NO BA|L0uTS FOR YOUTH | I I5
tion over a country that has the onerous and dubious distinction of being the
world’s leading jailer of young people? Where is the moral wrath over the racist prac­
tices that lead to the increasing criminalization of African American youth, partic­
ularly those who drop out of schools with “nearly one in four young black male
dropouts incarcerated or otherwise institutionalized on an average day.”11 As one
politician noted, “Dropping out of high school [has become] an apprenticeship for
prison.”12
The devastation wreaked by free-market policies has been largely financed in
the hard currency of human suffering that such policies have imposed on children,
readily evident in some astounding statistics that suggest a profound moral and polit­
ical contradiction at the heart of one of the richest democracies in the world. The
notion that children should be treated as a crucial social resource and represent for
any healthy society important ethical and political considerations about the quali­
ty of public life, the allocation of social provisions, and the role of the state as a
guardian of public interests appears to be lost. Children, for example, make up a dis­
proportionate share of the poor in the United States in that “they are 26 per cent
of the total population, but constitute 39 per cent of the poor.”13]ust as alarming­
ly, prior to the passage ofthe health care reform bill, over 8 million children lacked
health insurance,14 and millions lacked affordable child care and decent early child­
hood education. One of the most damaging statistics revealing how low a priority
children are in America can be seen in the fact that among the industrialized
nations in the world, the United States ranks first in billionaires and in defense
expenditures and yet ranks an appalling twenty-ninth in infant mortalityls As we
might expect, behind these grave statistics lie a series of decisions to favor those
already advantaged economically at the expense of the poor and socially vulnera­
ble. Moreover, for the last three decades we have witnessed, especially under the sec­
ond Bush administration, savage cuts to education, scientific research, and social
services such as nutritional assistance for impoverished mothers and veterans’ med­
ical care-all of which helped liind tax breaks for the inordinately rich. Sadly, it now
seems reasonable to assume that under the current financial crisis non-privileged
youth will experience even greater economic and educational hardships, while
becoming even more invisible to the larger society.
The toll in human suffering that results from these policies of punishment and
neglect becomes clear in shocking stories about poor white and minority youth who
literally die because they lack health insurance, often have to fend for themselves
in the face of life’s tragedies, and increasingly are excommunicated from the sphere
of human concern. Too many youth are now rendered invisible and disposable in a
world in which short-term investments yield quick profits while long-term social
invesunents in young people are viewed as a drag on the economy. lt gets worse. ln
what amounts to a national disgrace, one out every five children currently lives in
l I6 | SECTION IIIZ BRUTALIZINC YOUTH IN THE ACE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
poverty Morever,while 10 percent of white children live in poverty, 34 percent of
all black children live in poor families.16 With home foreclosures still on the rise,
school districts across the nation have identified and enrolled almost one million
homeless children.17 There are 1.7 million more children living in poverty today than
in 2000. Unfortunately, their numbers are growing at an exponential rate, as 1 in 50
children and teens is now living in crowded rooms in seedy welfare hotels, in emer­
gency shelters, or with relatives, or simply living on the streets.13
What is unique about these children and young people is not just the severity
of deprivations they experience daily, but how they have been forced to view the
world and redefine the nature of their own childhood between the borders of
hopelessness and despair. There is little sense of a brighter future lying just beyond
the shadows of highly policed and increasingly abandoned urban spaces. An entire
generation of youth will not have access to the jobs, material comforts, or social secu­
rities available to previous generations. These children are a new generation of youth
forced to grow up fast-they think, act, and talk like adults. They worry about their
families, which may be headed by a single parent or both parents out of work and
searching for a job; they wonder how their parents are going to get money to buy
food and what it will take to pay for a doctor. And these children are no longer con­
fined to so-called ghettoes. As the burgeoning landscape of poverty and despair
spreads across our cities, suburbs, and rural areas, these children make their pres­
ence felt everywhere-there are just too many to ignore or hide away in the usual­
ly contained and invisible spaces of disposability These young people constitute a
new and more unsettling scene of suffering, one that reveals not only vast inequal­
ities in our economic landscape but also portends a liiture that has no claim to a spr­
ited notion hope, characteristic of an aspiring democracy.
We are treated endlessly to stories in which young people are robbed of their
innocence as they are forced to worry about problems that are ordinarily the respon­
sibility of adults. Too many children find themselves living in cars or seedy motels,
or even worse, living on the streets. They think about gettingjobs to help their par­
ents buy food, put down money for an apartment, or simply get a motel room.
Childhood concerns about dating, sports, and hanging out with friends are now
replaced with more crucial, if not time-consuming and health-draining, concerns
about surviving on a daily basis.
These narratives just scratch the surface of a new social and economic reality,
as millions of children now find themselves suffering physical, psychological, and
developmental problems that thus far have gone unacknowledged by the Obama
administration, as it bails out the automotive industries, banks, and other financial
institutions. What kind of country have we become that we cannot protect our chil­
dren or offer them even the most basic requirements for survival? Where is the pub­
NO BAILOUTS FOR YOUTH I I I7
lic indignation over an administration that provides a multi-billion-dollar gift to
Wall Street but cannot develop a public works program to put poor white and
minority youth to work? I-low can the American people put up with a government
that is willing to subsidize and rescue the insurance giant American International
Group but do virtually nothing to provide assistance for the nearly half of all U.S.
children and 90 percent of black youth who will be on food stamps at some point
in their childhood?
Everywhere we tum, we see untold amounts of hardship and human suffering
among young and old alike. Millions of hard-working people have lost their jobs,
homes, hopes, and in some cases their sanity, while Wall Street zombies flourish
financially and reward their incompetence, failure, and moral indifference with
lavish bonuses, punctuated with renewed efforts to prevent any of the reforms that
would put a check on the corrupt practices that produced a global financial melt­
down. What does it mean to witness this type of suffering among so many children
and not do anything about it-our attentions quickly diverted to view the specta­
cles and moral indifference that characterize so much of the cut-throat world of real­
ity TV, zombie politics, and a consumer culture that shapes the sensibilities and inner
lives of adults and children alike? Obama’s attraction to the cultural capital ofthe
rich, his unwillingness to take risks, his Harvard-taught propensity for seeking mid­
dle ground, his increasing unwillingness to fight for the people who elected him,
and his willingness to disconnect from his own pre-election ideals make him look
increasingly not just weak but like a mere puppet of corporate power, an innocent
who has been practically eaten alive by the rich and powerful who now treat him
with a sense of scom and derision only matched by their own moral vacuity and arro­
gance. Of course, this might Suggest that I and others initially expected too much
from Obama, but that is not the case. I realize that reforming the current problems
facing the United States does not lie in the hands of one man but resides in chang­
ing the deeply structured economic and social relations of power and interests that
inform a mode of casino capitalism that for all intents and purposes is out of con­
trol. At the same time, Obama must be held responsible for the decisions he has
made--and, for the most part, those decisions that have shaped everything from
financial regulation to educational reform are not on the side of working- and
middle-class people but on the side of the rich and powerful.
At this moment in history, it is more necessary than ever to enter this debate
over the fate of American democracy by registering youth as a central theoretical,
moral, and political concern. Doing so reminds adults of their ethical and political
responsibility to future generations and will further legitimate what it means to
invest in youth as a symbol for nurturing civic imagination and collective resistance
in response to the suffering of others. Young people provide a powerful referent for
l I8 | SECTION IIIZ BRUTALIZINC YOUTH IN THE ACE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
a critical discussion about the long-term consequences of casino capitalism and its
hyper-market-driven policies, while also gesturing toward the need for putting
into place those conditions that make a democratic future possible. We have been
punishing children for a long time in the United States. Removed from the inven­
tory of social concerns and the list of cherished public assets, young people have been
either disparaged as a symbol of danger or simply rendered invisible.
Viewed as another casualty of the recession, youth are no longer included in a
discourse about the promise of a better future. Instead they are now considered part
of a disposable population whose presence threatens to recall repressed collective
memories of adult responsibility in the service of a social contract and democratic
ideals. Injustice and inequality have a long legacy in the United States, and their
most punishing modes and lethal effects have been largely directed against poor
white and minority children. The shameful condition of America’s youth exposes
not only their unbearable victimization but also those larger social and political forces
that speak to the callous hardening of a society that actively produces the needless
suffering and death of its children. The moral nihilism of a market society, the move
from a welfare to a warfare state, the persistent racism of the alleged “raceless” soci­
ety, the collapse of education into training, the deskilling of teachers and the mil­
itarizing of schools, the continued violations of civil liberties, the commodilication
of knowledge, and the rise of a pernicious corporate state work together to numb
us to the suffering of others, especially children.
The crisis of youth is symptomatic of the crisis of democracy, and it calls us to
account as much for the threat that it poses as for the challenges and possibilities
it invokes. One way of addressing our collapsing intellectual and moral visions
regarding young people is to imagine those policies, values, opportunities, and
social relations that both invoke adult responsibility and reinforce the ethical imper­
ative to provide young people, especially those marginalized by race and class, with
the economic, social, and educational conditions that make life livable and the
future sustainable. Clearly, the issue at stake here is not a one-off bailout or tem­
porary fix but concrete structural economic, educational, and political reforms that
provide everyone with real social, political, and individual rights and freedoms.
None of the problems facing this generation will be solved unless the institu­
tions, social relations, and values that legitimate and reproduce current levels of
inequality, power, and human suffering are dismantled, along with the formative cul­
ture that supports it. The very ideal of democracy has been hijacked by casino cap­
italism and its rampant structures of inequality and power. We catch a glimpse of
what this means in Peter Dreier’s observation that “Today, the richest one percent
of Americans has 22 percent of all income and about 40 percent of all wealth. This
is the biggest concentration of income and wealth since 1928.”19 This type of eco­
NO BA|LouTS FOR YOUTH | 1 I9
nomic inequality is not merely incompatible with a functioning democracy, it
makes democracy dysfunctional and corrupt. _lust as government can no longer out­
source its responsibilities, the American public can no longer allow its political sys­
tem to be govemed by the rich and powerful. Political culture has been emptied of
its democratic values and is in fiee fall, as it is now largely shaped by the most pow­
erful, politically corrupt, socially irresponsible, and morally tainted elements ofthe
society. The widening gap between the rich and the poor has to be addressed if
young people are to have a viable future. And that requires pervasive structural
reforms that constitute a real shift in both power and politics away from a market­
driven system that views too many children as disposable. We need to reimagine
what liberty, equality, and freedom might mean as truly democratic values and
practices.
Any society that endorses market principles as a template for shaping all
aspects of social life and cares more about the accumulation of capital than it does
about the fate of young people is in trouble. Next to the needs of the marketplace,
life has become cheap, if not irrelevant. We have lived too long with governments
and institutions that use power to promote violent acts, conveniently hiding their
guilt behind a notion of state secrecy or lofty claims to democracy, while selective­
ly punishing those considered expendable-in prisons, collapsing public schools, fos­
ter care institutions, and urban slums. Under the current regime of free-market
casino capitalism, children lack power and agency and are increasingly viewed as
either commodities or simply rendered disposable. lf Barack Obama’s call to address
the crucial problems facing young people is to be taken seriously, then the politi­
cal, economic, and institutional conditions that both legitimate and sustain a shame­
ful attack on youth have to be made visible, open to challenge, and transformed. This
can only happen by refusing the somnambulance and social amnesia that coincide
with the pretense ofa post-racial politics and the all-too-easy equation of free-mar­
ket fiindamentalism and democracy, especially given the effects such illusions have
on those marginalized by class and color. The road to recovery must itself with
new social movements willing to take risks and that embrace a vision of a democ­
racy that is on the side of children, particularly young children in need. It must
enable the conditions for youth to learn-to “grow,” as _Iohn Dewey once insisted,
as engaged social actors more alive to their responsibilities to fixture generations than
contemporary adult society has proven itself willing to be for them.

he shift to a society now governed through crime,1 market-driven values, and
the politics of disposability has radically transformed the public school as a site
for a civic and critical education. One major effect can be seen in the increasingly
popular practice of organizing schools through disciplinary practices that closely
resemble the culture of the prisons? For instance, many public schools, tradition­
ally viewed as nurturing, youth-friendly spaces dedicated to protecting and educat­
ing children, have become one ofthe most punitive institutions many young people
now face on a daily basis. Educating for citizenship, work, and the public good has
been replaced with models of schooling in which students, especially poor minor­
ity youth, are viewed either as a threat or as perpetrators of violence. When not
viewed as potential criminals, they are positioned as infantilized potential victims
of crime (on the Internet, at school, and in other youth spheres) who must endure
modes of goveming that are demeaning and repressive._]onathan Simon captures
this transformation of schools from a public good to a security risk in the follow­
ing comment:
Today, in the United States, it is crime that dominates the symbolic passageway to school
and citizenship. And behind this surface, the pathways of knowledge and power within the
school are increasingly being shaped by crime as the model problem, and tools of criminal
justice as the dominant technologies. Through the introduction of police, probation offi­
cers, prosecurors, and a host of private security professionals into the schools, new forms of
I24 | SECTION nn: BRUTAuz|NG YOUTH IN THE AGE OF zoMa|e POLITICS
expertise now openly compete with pedagogic knowledge and authority for shaping routines
and rituals of schools .... At its core, the implicit fallacy dominating many school policy
debates today consists of a gross conflation of virtually all the vulnerabilities of children and
youth into variations on the theme of crime. This may work to raise the salience of educa­
tion on the public agenda, but at the cost to students of an education embedded with
themes of "accountability," “zero tolerance," and “norm shaping."3
As the logic of the market and “the crime complex”4 frame a number of social actions
in schools, students are subjected to three particularly offensive policies, often
defended by school authorities and politicians under the rubric of school safety First,
students are increasingly subjected to zero tolerance laws that are used primarily to
punish, repress, and exclude them. Second, they are increasingly subjected to a “crime
complex” in which security staff using harsh disciplinary practices now displace the
normative functions teachers once provided both in and outside of the classroom.
Third, more and more schools are breaking down the space between education and
juvenile delinquency; substituting penal pedagogies for critical leaming and replac­
ing a school culture that fosters a discourse of possibility with a culture of fear and
social control. Consequently, many youth, especially poor minorities in urban school
systems, are not just being suspended or expelled from school but also have to bear
the terrible burden of being ushered into the dark precincts of juvenile detention
centers, adult courts, and prisons.
Once seen as an invaluable public good and laboratory for critical learning and
engaged citizenship, public schools are increasingly viewed as a site of crime, ware­
houses, or containment centers. Consequently, students are also reconceived through
the optic of crime as populations to be managed and controlled primarily by secu­
rity forces. In accordance with this perception of students as potential criminals and
the school as a site of disorder and delinquency, schools across the country since the
1980s have implemented zero tolerance policies that involve the automatic impo­
sition of severe penalties for first offenses of a wide range of undesirable, but often
harmless, behaviors. Based on the assumption that schools are rife with crime and
fueled by the emergence of a number of state and federal laws such as the Gun-Free
Schools Act of 1994, mandatory sentencing legislation, and the popular “three
strikes and you're out” policy many educators first invoked zero tolerance rules
against kids who brought firearms to schools. This was exacerbated by the high-pro­
file school shootings in the mid-1990s, the tragic shootings at Columbine High
School on April 20, 1999, and the more recent shootings at Virginia Tech.
But as the climate of fear increased, the assumption that schools were dealing
with a new breed of student-violent, amoral, and apathetitvbegan to take hold
in the public imagination. Moreover, as school safety became a top educational pri­
ority, zero tolerance policies were broadened and now include a range of behavioral
infractions that encompass everything from possessing dnigs or weapons to threat­
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES AND THE DEATH OF REASON I |25
ening other students-all broadly conceived. Under zero tolerance policies, forms
of punishment that were once applied to adults now apply to first graders. Students
who violate what appear to be the most minor rules-such as a dress code viola­
tion-are increasingly subjected to zero tolerance laws that have a disparate impact
on students of color while being needlessly punitive. The punitive nature of the zero
tolerance approach is on display in a number of cases where students have had to
face harsh penalties that defy human compassion and reason. An example is the
recent high-profile case of Zachary Christie, a 6-year-old first grader, who received
a 45-day suspension because he brought to school his favorite Cub Scout camping
utensil, which can serve as a knife, fork, and spoon. Rather than being treated as a
young boy who simply made a mistake, he was treated by the school as a suspect
who deserved to be punished. It seems that the only thing being punished in this
case was informed reason and critical judgment. Because ofthe national publicity
the case received, school officials modified their decision and allowed the boy to
return to school.
Most children who confront these harsh disciplinary procedures are not so lucky
One typical example is the case of an 8-year-old boy in the first grade at a Miami
elementary school who took a table knife to his school, using it to rob a classmate
of $1 in lunch money School officials claimed he was facing “possible expulsion and
charges of armed robbery.”5 In another incident that took place in December 2004,
“Porsche, a fourth-grade student at a Philadelphia, PA, elementary school, was
yanked out of class, handcuffed, taken to the police station and held for eight
hours for bringing a pair of 8-inch scissors to school. She had been using the scis­
sors to work on a school project at home. School district officials acknowledged that
the young girl was not using the scissors as a weapon or threatening anyone with
them, but scissors qualified as a potential weapon under state law.”6 It gets worse.
Adopting a rigidly authoritarian zero tolerance school discipline policy, the follow­
ing incident in the Chicago public school system signals both bad faith and terri­
ble judgment on the part of educators implementing these practices. According to
the report Education on Lockdown,
In February 2003, a 7-year-old boy was cuffed, shackled, and forced to lie face down for more
than an hour while being restrained by a security officer at Parker Community Academy on
the Southwest Side. Neither the principal nor the assistant principal came to the aid of the
first grader, who was so traumatized by the event he was not able to retum to school.7
Traditionally, students who violated school rules and the rights of others were sent
to the principal’s office, guidance counselor, or another teacher. Corrective discipline
in most cases was a matter of judgment and deliberation generally handled within
the school by the appropriate administrator or teacher. Under such circumstances,
young people could defend themselves, the context of their rule violation was
|26 | SECTION IIIZ BRUTALIZING YOUTH IN THE ACE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
explored (including underlying issues, such as problems at home, that may have trig­
gered the behavior in the first place), and the discipline they received was suited to
the nature of the offense. In other words, teachers and school administrators did
what they were supposed to do: listen, exercise judgment and discrimination, and
then decide how to handle an infraction. Today, in the age of standardized testing,
thinking, and acting, reason and judgment have been thrown out the window just
as teachers are increasingly being deskilled and forced to act as semi-robotic tech­
nicians good for little more than teaching for the test and serving as a reminder that
we are arriving at a day when the school curriculum will be teacher-proof Under
the Obama administration, teacher unions are under attack, charter schools are
viewed as the vanguard of reform, and teachers are forced into the role of clerks and
technicians who are obliged to prepare students to take standardized tests.
The script is an old one, but it is even more damaging today as pedagogy is
stripped not only of dissenting thought but of thought itself What does it mean
when Florida passes legislation claiming that only facts rather than interpretation
can be taught in social studies classrooms? What does it say about the value of pub­
lic education when Arizona bans ethnic studies on the grounds that it is divisive?
Why isn’t there public outrage over right-wing conservatives in Texas falsifying
information presented in school textbooks in order to assert their own ideological
ignorance-an ignorance that will now be taught to millions of students? The fog
of stupidity and abuse now engulfs both teachers and students. And the result will
be a generation of students deprived of the right to think critically, question author­
ity, and develop a sense of autonomous agency
This loss of autonomy produced by the sabotaging of critical education and the
rise of a culture of security now defines schools through the narrow optics of mea­
surement and discipline. Today, as school districts link up with law enforcement
agencies, young people find themselves not only being expelled or suspended in
record rates but also “subject to citations or arrests and referrals to juvenile or crim­
inal courts."8 Students who break even minor rules, such as pouring a glass of milk
on another student or engaging in a schoolyard fight, have been removed from the
normal school population, handed over to armed police, arrested, handcuffed,
shoved into patrol cars, taken to jail, fingerprinted, and subjected to the harsh dic­
tates of the juvenile and criminal justice systems.
How educators think about children through a vocabulary that has shifted from
hope to punishment is evident in the effects of zero tolerance policies, which crim­
inalize student behavior in ways that take an incalculable toll on their lives and their
future. As the former nationally syndicated journalist Ellen Goodman pointed
out, zero tolerance has become a code word for a “quick and dirty way of kicking
kids out” of schoo1.9 This becomes clear as cities such as Denver and Chicago, in
their eagerness to appropriate and enforce zero tolerance policies in their districts,
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES AND THE DEATH OF REASON | |27
do less to create a safe environment for students than simply kick more young peo­
ple out of the public school system, and these are not the young people who attract
the dominant media but poor white, brown, and black kids who increasingly are seen
as disposable. For example, between 2000 and 2004, the Denver Public School
System experienced a 71 percent increase in the number of student referrals to law
enforcement, many for non-violent behaviors. The Chicago School System in 2003
had over 8,000 students arrested, often for trivial infractions such as pushing, tar­
diness, and using spitballs. As part of a human waste management system, zero tol­
erance policies have been responsible for suspending and expelling black students
in record numbers. For instance, “in 2000, Blacks were 17 percent of public school
enrollment nationwide and 34 percent of suspensions.” And when poor black youth
are not being suspended under the merger of school security and law-and-order poli­
cies, they are increasingly at risk of falling into the school-to-prison pipeline. As the
Advancement Project points out, the racial disparities in school suspensions, expul­
sions, and arrests feed and mirror similar disparities in the juvenile and criminal jus­
tice systems.
[l]n 2002, Black youths made up 16% ofthe juvenile population but were 43% of juvenile
arrests, while White youths were 78% ofthe juvenile population but 55% of juvenile arrests.
Further, in 1999, minority youths accounted for 34% ofthe U.S.juvenile population but 62%
ofthe youths in juvenile facilities. Because higher rates of suspensions and expulsions are like­
ly to lead to higher rates of juvenile incarceration, it is not surprising that Black and Latino
youths are disproportionately represented among young people held in juvenile prisons.10
The city of Chicago, which has a large black student population, implemented a
take-no-prisoners approach in its use of zero tolerance policies, and the racially
skewed consequences are visible in grim statistics that reveal that “every dayg on aver­
age, more than 266 suspensions are doled out . . _ during the school year.” Moreover,
the number of expulsions has “mushroomed from 32 in 1995 to 3,000 in the school
year 2003-2004,"11 most affecting poor black youth.
As the culture of fear, crime, and repression dominates American public schools,
the culture of schooling is reconfigured through the allocation of resources used pri­
marily to hire more police, security staff and technologies of control and surveil­
lance. In some cases, schools such as the Palm Beach County system have established
their own police departments. Saturating schools with police and security person­
nel has created a host of problems for schools, teachers, and students-not to men­
tion that such policies tap into financial resources otherwise used for actually
enhancing learning. In many cases, the police and security guards assigned to
schools are not properly trained to deal with students and often use their authori­
ty in ways that extend far beyond what is either reasonable or even legal. When
Mayor Giuliani in 1998 allowed control of safety to be transferred to the New York
l28 | SECTION IIIZ BRUTALIZINC YOUTH IN THE ACE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
City Police Department, the effect was not only a jump in the number of police and
school safety agents but also an intensification of abuse, harassment, and arrests of
students throughout the school system.
One example of the war-on-terror tactics used domestically and impacting
schools can be seen in the use of the roving metal detector program in which the
police arrive at a school unannounced and submit all students to metal detector
scans. In Criminalizing t/Je Classroom, Elora Mukherjee describes some of the dis­
ruptions caused by the program:
As soon as it was implemented, the program began to cause chaos and lost instructional time
at targeted schools, each morning transforming an ordinary city school into a massive police
encampment with dozens of police vehicles, as many as sixty SSAs [School Security Agents]
and NYP§) oHicers, and long lines of students waiting to pass through the detectors to get
to class.1
As she indicates, the program does more than delay classes and instructional time:
it also fosters abuse and violence. The following incident at Wadleigh Secondary
School on November 17, 2006, provides an example of how students are abused by
some of the police and security guards. Mukherjee writes:
The oEicers did not limit their search to weapons and other illegal items. They confiscated
cell phones, iPods, food, school supplies, and other personal items. Even students with very
good reasons to carry a cell phone were given no exemption. A young girl with a pacemak­
er told an ofBcer that she needed her cell phone in case of a medical emergencjg but the phone
was seized nonetheless. When a student wandered out of line, officers screamed, “Get the
fixck back in line!" When a school counselor asked the officers to refrain from cursing, one
officeggetorted, “I can do and say whatever I want,” and continued, with her colleagues, to
curse.
Many students in New York City have claimed that the police are often disrespect­
iirl and verbally abusive, stating that “police curse at them, scream at them, treat them
like criminals, and are on ‘power trips.’ . . .At Martin Luther King _lr. High School,
one student reported, SSAs refer to students as ‘baby Rikers,’ implying that they are
convicts-in-waiting. At Louis D. Brandeis High School, SSAs degrade students
with comments like, ‘That girl has no ass.’”14 In some cases, students with severe
health problems had their phones taken away and, when they protested, were either
arrested or assaulted. Mukherjee reports that “A school aide at Paul Robeson High
School witnessed a Sergeant yell at, push, and then physically assault a child who
would not turn over his cell phone. The Sergeant hit the child in the jaw, wrestled
him to the ground, handcuffed him, removed him from school premises, and con­
fined him at the local precinct.”15 There have also been cases of teachers and
administrators being verbally abused, assaulted, and arrested while to pro­
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES AND THE DEATH OF REASON | l29
tect students from overzealous security personnel or police officers.
Under such circumstances, schools begin to take on the obscene and violent
contours one associates with maximum security prisons: unannounced locker search­
es, armed police patrolling the corridors, mandatory drug testing, and the ever-pre­
sent phalanx of lock-down security devices such as metal detectors, X-ray machines,
surveillance cameras, and other technologies of fear and control. Appreciated less
for their capacity to be educated than for the threat they pose to adults, students are
now treated as if they were inmates, often humiliated, detained, searched, and in
some cases arrested. Randall Beger is right in suggesting that the new “security cul­
ture in public schools [has] turned them into ‘learning prisons’ where the students
unwittingly become ‘guinea pigs’ to test the latest security devices.”16
Poor black and Latino male youth are particularly at risk in this mix of demon­
ic representation and punitive modes of control as they are the primary object of not
only racist stereotypes but also a range of disciplinary policies that criminalize
their behavior.17 Such youth, increasingly viewed as a burden and dispensable,
now bear the brunt of these assaults by being expelled from schools, tried in the
criminal justice system as adults, and arrested and jailed at rates that far exceed those
of their white counterparts.” While black children make up only 15 percent ofthe
juvenile population in the United States, they account for 46 percent of those put
behind bars and 52 percent of those whose cases end up in adult criminal courts.
Shockingly, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, “[a] or detention
cell after a child or youth gets into trouble is the only universally guaranteed child
policy in America.”19
Students being miseducated, criminalized, and arrested through a form of
penal pedagogy in lock-down schools that resemble prisons is a cruel reminder of
the degree to which mainstream politicians and the American public have turned
their backs on young people in general and poor minority youth in particular. As
schools are reconfigured around the model of the prison, crime becomes the cen­
tral metaphor used to define the nature of schooling, while criminalizing the behav­
ior of young people becomes the most valued strategy in mediating the relationship
between educators and students. The consequences of these policies for young
people suggest not only an egregious abdication of responsibility-as well as rea­
son, judgment, and restraint-on the part of administrators, teachers, and parents,
but also a new role for schools as they become more prison-like, eagerly adapting
to their role as an adjunct of the punishing state.
As schools define themselves through the lens of crime and merge with the dic­
tates ofthe penal system, they eliminate a critical and nurturing space in which to
educate and protect children in accordance with the ideals of a democratic society.
As central institutions in the youth disposability industry, public schools now serve
to discipline and warehouse youth, while they also put in place a circuit of policies
l3O I SECTION IIII BRUTALIZINC YOUTH IN THE AGE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
and practices to make it easier for minority youth to move from schools into the
juvenile justice system and eventually into prison. The combination of school pun­
ishments and criminal penalties has proven a lethal mix for many poor minority
youth and has transformed schools from spaces of youth advocacy, protection,
hope, and equity to military fortresses, increasingly well positioned to mete out injus­
tice and humiliation, transforming the once-nurturing landscapes that young peo­
ple are compelled to inhabit. Rather than confront the war on youth, especially the
increasing criminalization of their behavior, schools now adopt policies that both
participate in and legitimate the increasing absorption of young people into the juve­
nile and adult criminal justice system. Although state repression aimed at children
is not new, what is unique about the current historical moment is that the forces of
domestic militarization are expanding, making it easier to put young people in
rather than provide them with the education, services, and care they need to face
the growing problems characteristic of a democracy under siege. War abroad takes
a toll not only in the needless loss of lives but also diverts valuable resources from
expanding public goods, especially schools and the quality of life of the young
people who inhabit them. As minority youth increasingly become the object of
severe disciplinary practices in public schools, many often find themselves vulner­
able and powerless as they are thrown into juvenile and adult courts or, even worse,
into overcrowded and dangerous juvenile correctional institutions and sometimes
adult prisons.
In this insufferable climate of increased repression and unabated exploitation,
young people and communities of color become the new casualties in an ongoing
war againstjustice, freedom, social citizenship, and democracy. Given the switch in
public policy from social investment to a policy of testing, measurement, and pun­
ishment that President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan seem will­
ing to support, it is clear that schools will continue to be the object of malign neglect,
viewed less as a public good than a public pathology. Moreover, as government pol­
icy continues to push for high-stakes testing, militarizing schools, and addressing
educational reform through the support of charter schools, it is clear that young peo­
ple for whom race and class loom large have become disposable and will be the first
to be neglected and eventually punished. After all, these are the young people who
are viewed as needing more resources and services while in the end lowering test
scores. According to the fact that schools today are viewed as instruments of pro­
duction and adjuncts of the corporation, they are judged largely through that which
can only be quantified. Consequently, public schools and the values and principles
through which they organized have more in common with factories and prisons than
with an education that prepares people to be knowledgeable, compassionate, and
critically engaged citizens.
How much longer can a nation ignore those youth who lack the resources and
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES AND THE DEATH OF REASON | 131
opportunities that were available, in a partial and incomplete way, to previous gen­
erations? And what does it mean when a nation becomes frozen ethically and
imaginatively in providing its youth with a future of hope and opportunity? Under
such circumstances, it is time for parents, young people, educators, writers, labor
unions, and social movements to take a stand and to remind themselves that not only
do young people deserve more, but so does an aspiring democracy that has any sense
of justice, vision, and hope for the future.20

Brutalizing Kids
Painful Lessons in the Pedagogy of
School Violence
ombie politics has as one of its distinctive features the violence it wages
against young people. For instance, on May 20, 2009, Marshawn Pitts, a 15­
year-old African American boy who is also a special needs student, was walking
down the corridor of the Academy for Learning High School in Dolton, Illinois.
A police officer in the school noticed that the boy’s shirt was not tucked in and start­
ed shouting and swearing at him. Pitts claims that he immediately started to tuck
in his shirt, but it was too late. Within seconds, the police officer pushed him into
the lockers, repeatedly punched him, and then slammed him to the ground and
pushed his face to the floor. The officer then applied a face-down take-down hold
to the child, a maneuver that has resulted in over twenty deaths nationwide and is
banned in eight states. Pitts said he was terrified and was having a hard time
breathing as a result of the forceful restraint. Because of this unprovokcd attack by
a police officer who is supposed to protect kids in school, the young man ended up
with a broken nose and a bruised jaw.
In case the reader suspects I have confused the facts, the assault was caught on
school security cameras and ended up on YouTube.1 Indeed, a 15-year-old boy with
an early childhood brain injury and a learning disorder, attending a school for spe­
cial needs children, was tackled in the school and suffered injuries by a police offi­
cer because ofa dress code violation. Pitts was not carrying a weapon. I-Ie did not
threaten anyone. He was not dealing drugs. In fact, he appears to have given an
entirely new meaning to what constitutes a clear and present danger, warranting the
l34 | SECTION IIII BRUTALIZING YOUTH IN THE AGE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
use of force by the police-he simply did not have his shirt tucked in, and for this
he was beaten by a police ofticer three times his size. Harmless acts of indiscretion
are now elevated to the status of a dangerous crime.
One could argue that this case is so bizarre and outrageous that the only log­
ical explanation is to call into question the cop’s (not the young man’s) mental capac­
ities. How could a reasonable adult trained as a professional policeman so viciously
assault a young boy for no apparent or legitimate reason? But that is too easy. The
brutalizing behavior exhibited by this unhinged police officer would be better
understood as symptomatic of a set of larger forces in American society that are
increasingly defining kids through a youth crime complex that touches almost
every aspect of their lives-extending from the streets they walk on to the schools
and community centers in which they spend most of their time.
This is not meant to suggest that school violence is not a real problem. Schools
have an obligation to create safe environments for all of our children, environments
that are welcoming rather than threatening, conducive to real learning, and atten­
tive to the problems students face. Administrators and teachers should connect to
student histories, be respectful of their experiences, encourage their voices, and pro­
tect their rights. At the same time, school safety must take seriously the broader edu­
cational goal of educating students “to participate in the complex and infinitely
worthwhile labor of forming citizens, men and women capable of furthering what’s
best about us and forestalling what's worst.”2
The tragic death of 16-year-old Chicago student Derrion Albert, captured on
video and widely shown on the news;3 the 49 school-age children who have been
killed in Chicago by October 2009; the 300 wounded in 2009; and the fact that one
recent study states that 61 percent of all school children are exposed to varying
degrees of violence, speak to the culture of violence that young people face every day
both in and out of schools. What bears repeating is that these acts of violence took
place in and out of schools. School violence cannot be disconnected from the larg­
er violence that filters through American society, nor can it be addressed by demo­
nizing or beating kids, or, incredulously, militarizing their schools. Nor can it be
understood by simply pumping money into cash-strapped schools to promote stan­
dardized testing, which borders on a kind of symbolic violence. The underlying eco­
nomic, social, and political causes of violence are largely tied to a society in which
young people, especially poor minority youth, simply do not matter any longer and
are considered disposable. Removed from the discourse of social investment, if not
the social contract itself, they are destined to be unemployed, having been ware­
housed in schools often lacking the most basic resources, and subject to a culture
of violence from which they can rarely escape and almost never transform on their
own.
In a society ruled by the living undead, young people are increasingly the vic­
BRUTALIZING Kms | 135
tims of adult abuse and are maligned as dangerous and undeserving of even mild
forms of social investment. Hence, it is not surprising, given how little money or
time is spent on them, that they are treated as a threat, and their behavior endless­
ly monitored, controlled, and subject to harsh disciplinary measures. Schools, espe­
cially for poor white and minority children, are largely viewed as either testing
centers where young people are simply bored into passivity or submission, or they
are modeled after prisons-subject to punishing, zero tolerance policies, lock­
downs, constant surveillance, humiliating security measures, intimidation, and
sometimes assault, by security and police who are often armed and roam the cor­
ridors. ln short, if you are poor black, brown, or white youth, you are not consid­
ered a viable student or a productive citizen but a potential criminal.
Schools now form partnerships with the police and private security agencies.
Teachers, once the heroes in this coming-of-age narrative, are now a sideshow. Most
are deskilled, reduced to technicians teaching for the high-stakes testing machine
and often forced to share their responsibilities with armed security forces.
Administrators now confuse management with leadership and become the pawns
of corporate and punishing forces they can no longer control. Instead of investing
in disadvantaged youth, American society now punishes them, and instead of being
prepared for a productive life in the larger society, too many young people are
pushed and shoved into a criminal justice system. They move from the schools
directly to the juvenile detention centers, ifnot adult prisons. And when money is
pumped into the schools, it is increasingly diverted from addressing real problems
such as the need for more teachers, social workers, health workers, teaching aides,
and safe avenues of protection for kids travelling to and from school. Instead, the
money is invested in metal detectors, surveillance cameras, security guards, high
security fences, and armed police with dogs.
While all youth are now suspect, poor minority youth have become the prima­
ry targets of modes of social regulation, crime control, and disposability-now the
major prisms that define many of the public institutions and spheres that govern
their lives. The model of policing that governs all kinds of social behaviors and inter­
actions also constructs a narrow range of meaning through which young people
define themselves. This rhetoric and practice of policing, surveillance, and punish­
ment have little to do with the project of youth as the social investment of the future
and a great deal to do with increasing powerliil modes of disciplinary regulation,
pacification, and control-elements comprising a “youth control complex” whose
prominence in American society points to a state of affairs in which the claims of
democracy go unheard.
Students being miseducated, mistreated, criminalized, and arrested through a
form of penal pedagogy in locked-down schools that resemble prisons is a vicious
and incredibly visible index of the degree to which mainstream politicians and the
136 | SECTION IIII BRUTALIZINC YOUTH IN THE ACE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
American public have turned their backs on young people in general and poor
minority youth in particular. As schools are reconfigured to resemble prisons, crime
becomes the central metaphor used to define the school environment, while crim­
inalizing the behavior of young people becomes the most valued strategy in medi­
ating the relationship between educators and students. The consequences of these
policies for young people suggest not only an egregious abdication of responsibil­
ity-as well as reason, judgment, and restraint-on the part of administrators,
teachers, and parents, but also a new role for schools as they become more prison­
like and more segregated as a consequence, eagerly adapting to their role as an
adjunct of the punishing state.
One wonders how many more young people have to be brutalized in their
schools and killed outside of schools before the American public wakes up and takes
seriously not only its responsibility to young people but also its commitment to a
mode of politics and a future that is on the side of young people rather than a vision
shaped largely by the values of the corporate state and the disciplinary apparatus­
es of the punishing criminal justice system. What do the video of Marshawn Pitts
being brutalized by a police officer and the equally heartbreaking video of Derrion
Albert being beaten to death by his peers tell us about what kids are actually learn­
ing in schools? Far too often, dominant media, school administrators, politicians,
and others insist on the pathology of privatized and collective violence that runs
roughshod over kids’ lives in and out of schools. In the case of the police officer who
brutally beat Marshawn, the comforting solution is to privatize the assault, an
example of an individual pathology, the work of a “bad apple.” The beating of
Derrion by other kids similarly speaks to an alleged culture of depravity that has been
defined for the last three decades as black, urban, and dangerous. In both cases, the
systemic neoliberal economic, institutional, educational, and racist underpinnings
of such violence disappear into the logic of individual pathology or into the always
crowd-pleasing categorization of the culture of blackness as pathological. Neither
answer will do, at least not in an aspiring democracy. Finally, what do these acts of
violence against children tell us about what kids are learning through the pedagog­
ical force of the larger culture? What do they tell us about a society that refuses to
recognize that the issue is not what is wrong with children, but what is wrong with
American society?

Tortured Memories and
the Culture of War
r the last decade, we have lived through an historical period in which the
United States surrendered its already tenuous claim to democracy. The frames
through which democracy apprehends the lives of others as human beings worthy
of respect, dignity, and human rights were sacrificed to a mode of politics and cul­
ture that simply became an extension of war, both at home and abroad. At home
the punishing state increasingly replaced the welfare state, however ill-conceived,
as more and more individuals and groups were treated as redundant, undcserving
of those safety nets and basic protections that provide the conditions for living with
a sense of security and dignity?
Under such conditions, basic social supports were replaced by an increase in the
production of prisons, the expansion of the criminal justice system into everyday
life, and the further erosion of crucial civil liberties. Shared responsibilities gave way
to shared fears, and the only distinction that seemed to resonate in the culture was
between friends and patriots, on the one hand, and dissenters and enemies on the
other? State violence not only became acceptable, it was normalized as the govern­
ment spied on its citizens, suspended the right of habeas corpus, sanctioned police
brutality against those who questioned state power, relied on the state secrets priv­
ilege to hide its crimes, and increasingly reduced those public spheres that were
designed to protect children to containment centers and warehouses that modeled
themselves after prisons.
138 | SECTION IIIZ BRUTALIZINC YOUTH IN THE ACE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
Fear both altered the landscape of democratic rights and values and dehuman­
ized a population increasingly willing to look the other way as large segments of the
population were dehumanized, incarcerated, or simply treated as disposable? The
dire consequences can be seen every day as the media reports a stream of tragic sto­
ries about decent people losing their homes, more and more young people being
incarcerated, and increasing numbers of people living in their cars, on the streets,
or in tent cities. Tb: New York Times offers up a frontpage story about young peo­
ple leaving their recession-ridden families in order to live on the street, often sur­
viving by selling their bodies for money.‘ Reports surface in the dominant media
about unspeakable horrors being inflicted on children tortured in the “death cham­
bers" of Iraq, Cuba, and Afghanistan’ And yet the American public barely blinks.
The Bush administration further eroded a culture inspired by democratic val­
ues, replacing it with a culture of war. During the last decade, the language and
ghostly shadow of war became all-embracing, not only eroding the distinction
between war and peace, but putting into play a public pedagogy in which nearly
every aspect of the culture was shaped by militarized knowledge, values, and ideals.
From video games and Hollywood films aided by the Department of Defense to the
ongoing militarization of public and higher education, the notion of the common
good was subordinated to a military metaphysics, war-like values, and the dictates
of the national security state.” War was no longer the last resort of a state intent on
defending its territory. It morphed into a new form of public pedagogy-a type of
cultural war machine-designed to shape and lead the society. War became the
foundation for a politics that employed military language, concepts, and policing
relations to address problems far beyond the familiar terrains of battle. In some cases,
war was so aestheticized by the dominant media that it resembled an advertisement
for a tourist industry The upshot is that the meaning of war was rhetorically, visu­
ally, and materially expanded to name, legitimate, and wage battles against social
problems involving drugs, poverty, and our newfound enemy, Mexican immigrants.
As war became normalized as t.he central fimction of power and politics, it
became a regular and normative element of American society, legitimated by a state
of exception and emergency that became permanent rather than temporary. As the
production of violence reached beyond traditionally defined enemies and threats,
the state now took aim at terrorism, shifting its register of power by waging war on
a concept, broadening its pursuits, tactics, and strategies against more than any spe­
cific state, army, or location. The enemy was omnipresent, all the more difficult to
root out and all the more convenient for expanding the tactics of surveillance, the
culture of fear, and the resources of violence. War was now a commonplace feature
of American domestic and foreign policy, as the country engaged in a battle that had
no definitive end and demanded the constant use of violence.
It is difficult to imagine how any democracy could not be corrupted when war
TORTURED MEMORIES AND THE CULTURE OF WAR | |39
becomes the foundation of politics. Any democracy that makes war and state vio­
lence the organizing principle of society cannot survive for long, at least as a demo­
cratic entity. The country descended into a period in which society was increasingly
organized through the production of both symbolic and material violence. A cul­
ture of cruelty emerged in the media, especially in the talk radio circuit, in which a
sordid nationalism and a morally bankrupt nativism merged with a hyper-militarism
and masculinity that scorned both reason and all those who fit into the stereotype
of other, which appeared to include everyone who was not white and Christian.
Dialogue, reason, and thoughtfulness slowly disappeared from the public realm as
every encounter was framed within circles of certainty, staged as a fight to the death.
As the civic and moral center of the country disappeared under the Bush adminis­
tration, the language ofthe marketplace provided the only referent for understand­
ing the obligations of citizenship and global responsibility, undetened by a growing
war machine and culture that produced jobs, goods, and furthered the war econo­
my.
The war abroad entered a new phase with the release of the photos of detainees
being tortured at Abu Ghraib prison. War as organized violence was stripped of its
noble aims and delusional goal of promoting democracy and revealed state violence
at its most degrading and dehumanizing moment. State power had become an
instrument of torture, ripping into the flesh of human beings, raping women, and
most abominably torturing children. Democracy had become a shell that not only
defended the unthinkable but inflicted the most horrible mutilations on both adults
and children deemed to be the enemies of democracy. But the mutilations were also
inflicted against the body politic as politicians such as former Vice President Dick
Cheney defended torture while the media addressed the question of torture not as
a violation of democratic principles or human rights but as a strategy that may or
may not produce concrete information. The utilitarian arguments used to defend a
market-driven economy that only recognizes cost-benefit analyses had now reached
their logical end point as similar arguments were now used to defend torture, even
when it involved children. The pretense of democracy was stripped bare as it was
revealed over and over again that the United States had become a torture state, align­
ing itself with infamous dictatorships such as those in Argentina and Chile during
the 1970s. The United States government under the Bush administration had
finally arrived at a point where the metaphysics of war, organized violence, and state
terrorism prevented them from recognizing how much they were emulating the very
acts of terrorism they claimed to be fighting. The circle had now been completed
as the warfare state had been transformed into a torture state. Everything become
permissible both at home and abroad just as the legal system, along with the mar­
ket system, legitimated a punishing and ruthless mode of Economic Darwinism that
viewed morality if not democracy itself as a weakness to be either scorned or
l4O | SECTION IIII BRUTALIZINC YOUTH IN THE ACE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
ignored. Self-regulation now drove the market, and narrowly defined individual
interests set the parameters of what was possible. The public collapsed into the pri­
vate, and social responsibility was reduced to the arbitrary desires of the hermetic,
asocial self Not surprisingly, the inhuman and degrading not only entered public
discourse and shaped the debate about war, state violence, and human rights abus­
es but served to legitimate such practices. Torture was normalized, and the promise
of an aspiring democracy was irreparably damaged.
The United States under the Bush administration embarked on a war on ter­
ror that not only defended torture as a matter of oHicial policy but furthered the con­
ditions for the emergence ofa culture of cruelty that profoundly altered the political
and moral landscape ofthe country. As torture became normalized under the Bush
administration, it not only corrupted American ideals and political culture, it also
passed over to the dark side in sanctioning the unimaginable and unspeakable tor­
ture of children. Wlmile the rise ofthe torture state has been a subject of intense con­
troversy, too little has been said by intellectuals, academics, artists, writers, parents,
and politicians about how state violence under the Bush administration set in
motion a public pedagogy and political culture that not only legitimated the system­
atic torture of children but did so with the complicity of a dominant media that
either denied such practices or simply ignored them. The focus on children here is
deliberate because young people provide a powerful referent for not only the long­
term consequences of social policies, if not the future itself, but also because they
offer a crucial index to measure the moral and democratic values of a nation.
Children are the heartbeat of politics because they speak to the best of its possibil­
ities and promises, and yet they have in the last few years become the vanishing point
of moral debate, either irrelevant because of their age, discounted because they are
largely viewed as commodities, or scorned because they are considered a threat to
adult society.
I have written in Youth in a Suspect Society and in this book that how we edu­
cate our youth is connected to the collective fixture we hope for.’ Actually, how we
educate youth became meaningless as a moral issue under the Bush administration,
because youth were not only devalued and considered unworthy of a decent life and
future (one reason they were denied adequate health care), they were also reduced
to the status of the inhuman and depraved and subjected to cruel acts of torture in
sites that were as illegal as they were barbaric. In this instance, youth became the
negation of not only politics but also the future itself But more is at stake here than
making such crimes visible. There is also the moral and political imperative of rais­
ing serious questions about the challenges the Obama administration must address
in light of this shameful period in American history, especially ifit wants to reverse
such policies and make a claim to restoring any vestige of American democracy. Of
course, when a country makes torture legal and extends the disciplinary mechanisms
TORTURED MEMORIES AND THE CULTURE OF WAR | l4l
of pain, humiliation, and suffering to children, it suggests that far too many peo­
ple looked away while this was happening and in doing so allowed conditions to
emerge that made the unspeakable act of justifying the torture of children a mat­
ter of state policy It is time for Americans to face up to these crimes and engage
in a national dialogue about the political, economic, educational, and social condi­
tions that allowed such a dark period to emerge in American history and to hold
those responsible accountable for such acts.
The Obama administration is under fire for its embrace of many of Bush’s poli­
cies, but what is most disturbing is its willingness to make war, secrecy, and the sus­
pension of civil liberties a central feature of its own policies. Obama, in his desire
to look ahead, recycles a dangerous form of historical and social amnesia and over­
looks the political and civic pathology he inherited. Memory at its best is unsettling
and sometimes even dangerous in its call for individuals to become moral and
political witnesses, to take risks, to embrace history not merely as a critique, but as
a warning about how fragile democracy is and what will likely happen when the
principles, ideals, and elements ofthe culture that sustain it are allowed to slip away,
overtaken by forces that embrace death rather than life, fear rather than hope,
insularity rather than solidarity Robert Hass, the American poet, has suggested that
the job of education, its political job, “is to refresh the idea of justice going dead in
us all the time.” justice is slipping away, once again, under the Obama administra­
tion, but it is not just the government’s job to keep it from “going dead." It is also
our job-as parents, citizens, individuals, and educators-not merely as a matter of
social obligation or moral responsibility, but as an act of politics, agency, and pos­
sibility.

Youth Beyond the
Politics of Hope
he counter-revolution that has gripped the United States since the late 19805
has been somewhat modified with the election of Barack Obama to the pres­
idency. Unfortunately the dark times that befell us under the second Bush admin­
istration have far from disappeared, especially for young people. The assault that
the second Bush administration waged on practically every remnant of the public
good-from the Constitution to the environment to public education-appears to
have somewhat lessened its grip as the Cbama regime moves into its second year
in power. Yet the range, degree, and severity ofthe problems the Obama team has
inherited from the Bush administration seem almost too daunting to address suc­
cessfully: a war raging in two countries, a legacy of torture and secret prisons, a dis­
mantling of the regulatory apparatus, a poisonous inequality that allocates resources
to the rich and misery to the poor, an imperial presidency that shredded the bal­
ance of power, a looming ecological apocalypse, a mined reputation abroad, and a
fmancial crisis that is almost unprecedented in American history-policies and con­
ditions that have brought great suffering to millions of Americans and many mil­
lions more throughout the world. But the crisis that is most often forgotten or
repressed in the daily headlines of gloom is the war that is being waged at home,
primarily against young people, who have historically been linked to the promise
of a better life, one that they would both inherit and reproduce for future genera­
tions. In a radical free-market culture, when hope is precarious and bound to com­
modities and a corrupt financial system, young people are no longer at risk: they
144 | SECTION IIIZ BRUTALIZINC YOUTH IN THE ACE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
are the risk Young people are no longer troubled: they are trouble.
The conditions produced by the financial crisis have resulted in the foreclosure
of not only millions of family homes but also the future of young people, as the
prospects of the unborn are mortgaged off in the interests of corporate power and
profits. As wealth moved furiously upward into private hands for the last several
decades,1 any talk about the future has less to do with young people than with short­
term investments, quick turnovers in profits, and the dismantling ofthe welfare state.
Moreover, the destruction of the welfare state, or even better the social state, has
gone hand-in-hand with the emergence of a prison-industrial complex and a new
penal state that regulates, controls, contains, and punishes those who are not priv­
ileged by the benefits of class, color, immigration status, and gender. How else to
explain a national prison population that has grown from 200,000 in 1973 to
slightly over 2.3 million in 2010? lt gets worse. The Bureau of _lustice Statistics
reports that at the end of 2007 “over 7.3 million people were on probation, in
or prison, or on parole-3.2 percent of all U.S. adult residents or 1 in every 31
adults.”2
As policing, containment, and imprisonment merge with the market-driven dic­
tates of casino capitalism, the reasons for and redress of misfortune are now placed
entirely in the hands of isolated individuals. As the circuitry of social control and
power redefines the meaning of youth, particularly those marginalized by class and
color, young people are subjected to a number of indiscriminate, cruel, and poten­
tially illegal practices by the criminal justice system. ln the age of instant credit and
quick profits, human life is reduced to just another commodity to be bought and
sold, and the logic of short-term investments undercuts long-term investments in
public welfare, young people, and a democratic fI.1t`L11'C. Not surprisingly, young
people as a symbol of long-term commitment are now viewed as a liability rather
than an asset. Barack Obama repeatedly insisted both before and after his election
that the United States must live up to its obligations to future generations. While
Obama has only been in office for a few years, it is becoming increasingly d@cult
to see how young people are benefitting from that promise. Obama's economic poli­
cies are being shaped by people who caused the crisis, thus condemning children
to massive levels of unemployment and a future without hope. His education poli­
cies are simply an extension of the discredited Bush approach to schooling, and Ame
Duncan, the secretary of education, appears unusually il.literate when it comes to
being able to pose a democratic vision for education, given his love of the market,
testing, and his dislike for any mode of knowledge and classroom pedagogy that can­
not be measured. Duncan’s policies tum the language of school reform into the dis­
course of punishment and extend the neoliberal, zombie-like war being waged
against young people. For example, as jesse Hagopian points out, the
vourn-4 BEYOND THE PoL|T|CS OF HOPE | 145
Race to the Top Initiative is tied to a $4.3 billion fund to make states compete for desper­
ately needed education money by using eligibility requirements to push for charter schoolw
schools publicly handed by taxpayers, yet run privately, outside the control of local school
boards-and merit pay schemes where teachers are paid according to student test scores.
Ame's turnaround play proposes closing some 5,000 schools across the country and firing
entire teaching staffs at schools perceived to be failing.3
When Jesse Hagopian interviewed Duncan, he asked him why he is putting money
into charter schools when a recent Stanford study suggested that public schools on
the whole outperformed charter schools. I-lagopian’s point was that if public schools
are outperforming charter schools, why not invest public money in schools that are
accountable to public control? In response, Duncan provided what can only be
viewed as a nonsensical answer: “There is nothing inherently good or bad about
charters.”
Not only is this answer nonsensical, but it reveals the lack of compassion and
understanding necessary to curb the kind of violence being waged against young
people in public schools, on the streets, and in a range of other spheres. Clearly, the
war against young people does not begin and end with public schooling. Equally
important is the need to recognize that American society is still in a state of per­
manent war, and many young people, especially poor minorities, will continue to die
or be maimed in imperial struggles abroad. We are still the largest arms dealer in
the world, and we have a Republican Party whose only goal seems to be to block
every policy Obama proposes regardless of whether it is good for the country as a
whole. The winners in this logic are the militarists, the defense industries, the
bankers, the most powerfiil corporations, the ruling elite, the advocates of ideolog­
ical rigidity, and commanding financial institutions.
Under such conditions, there is a need to analyze the forces that ushered in such
dark times and examine their most unlikely and often invisible victims-those
young people who now symbolize trouble rather than promise, and who experience
daily the repercussions of adult neglect, ifnot scorn, especially those youth for whom
race and class loom large in their lives. This is a generation of young people who
have been betrayed by the irresponsibility of their elders and relegated to the mar­
gins of society, often in ways that suggest that they are an excess, redundant, a drain
on the empire of consumption-a population who, in the age of rampant greed and
rabid individualism, appear to be largely expendable and disposable.
For many young people, these are dangerous times, and there is a need to
develop a new language for addressing both the suffering many young people expe­
rience, albeit to different degrees, and the promise that an aspiring democracy
might offer them. We seem to live at a time when politics is divorced from a sense
of outrage as well as a sense of hope. In the face ofa culture awash in consumerism,
l46 | SECTION IIII BRUTALIZINC YOUTH IN THE ACE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
spectacularized hyper-violence, trash television, racist talk radio, and trivialized
journalism, there seems to be little concern, if not understanding, of a number of
forces-including an unfettered free-market ideology, a dehumanizing economic
system, the rise of the racially skewed punishing state, and the attack on public and
higher education-that have come together to pose a threat to young people and
that are so extreme that they can be accurately described as a “war on youth.”
Yet, in spite of such manufactured public indifference, it is imperative that edu­
cators, parents, and other concerned Americans do everything they can to make vis­
ible those forces responsible for the dire state of today's youth. Clearly, such an
intervention must arise from the belief that individual and collective resistance is
bom out of awareness, critical education, discerning judgment, and an ethic of mutu­
ality-all of which suggests a struggle that is as educational as it is political, with
no line dividing one from the other. While there were good reasons to celebrate ini­
tially the Obama victory, what has become clear is that it never offered any guar­
antees that the political, economic, and social conditions that have brought us to the
brink of disaster would fundamentally change. Substantive and lasting change
must come from below: from young people, students, workers, intellectuals, artists,
academics, parents, workers, labor unions, social movements, and other individu­
als and groups willing not just to demonstrate for equality, freedom, and social jus­
tice but to organize in order to push hope over the tipping point, push politics in
a new democratic and sociallyjust direction, and engage in a collective struggle that
takes power away from political and corporate elites, retuming it to the people who
are the real source of any viable democracy
As I have pointed out in much of my work, the changing punitive conditions
youth now face in the new millennium and the degree to which they have been put
at risk by reactionary social policies, institutional mismanagement, and shifting cul­
tural attitudes has assumed the status of a low-intensity war. While youth have
always represented an ambiguous category, they have within the last years been
under assault in ways that are entirely new, and they now face a world that is far more
dangerous than at any other time in recent history. And these new conditions
demand a new set of categories and vocabulary for understanding the changing
problems youth face within the relentless expansion of a global market society, one
that punishes all youth by treating them largely as commodities.
But if the commodification of American society represents a soft war on youth,
the hard war takes a different and more extreme form and subjects poor youth and
youth of color to the harshest elements, values, and dictates of a growing youth­
crime complex, governing them through a logic of punishment, surveillance, and
control. In this instance, even as the corporate state is in turmoil, it is transformed
into a punishing state, and certain segments of the youth population become the
object of a new mode of zombie-like governance based on the crudest forms of dis­
YOUTH BEYOND THE POLITICS OF HOPE | 147
ciplinary control. For example, a recent study, Tbe Consequences ofDropj>ing Out gf
Hig/J School, published by Northeastem University, states that on any given day “1.4%
of the nation's 16-24 year olds were institutionalized of whom nearly 93% were
residing in correctional facilities (jails, prisons,juvenile detention centers).”5 These
figures become even more alarming when analyzed through the harsh realities of
economic deprivation and racial disadvantage. Nearly one in every ten young male
high school dropouts was either in jail or juvenile detention. And for African
American youth, the figure jumps to one in four high school dropouts being incar­
cerated. There are over 6.2 million high school dropouts in the United States, and
they lack both decent educational opportunities, adequate job-training programs,
and the chance for decent employment. For instance, the jobless rate for young
African American males has risen to a staggering 69 percent while for whites it is
54 percent. What becomes clear is that the high school dropout and unemployment
rates are increasingly driving staggering incarceration rates for young people. As this
recession unfolds, young people, especially poor minorities who fail to finish high
school, bear the brunt of a system that leaves them uneducated and jobless, ultimate­
ly offering them one of the two bailouts available for populations largely considered
disposable-either the juvenile detention center or prison. What does it say about
a society that can put trillions of dollars into two useless wars, offer generous tax
cuts for the rich, and bail out corrupt banks and insurance industries but cannot pro­
vide a decent education and job training opportunities for its most disadvantaged
youth?
Out of ethical necessity, any discourse about youth should raise serious ques­
tions about the social and political responsibility of educators in addressing the plight
of young people today. What is the purpose of higher education and its faculties in
light ofthe current assault on young people, especially since it is education that pro­
vides the intellectual foundation and values for young people to understand, inter­
rogate, and transform when necessary the world in which they live? Matters of
popular consciousness, public sentiment, and individual and social agency are far too
important as part of a larger political and educational struggle not be taken serious­
ly by academics who advocate the long and difficult project of democratic reform.
Tragically, few intellectuals providing critical commentary on the current conditions
affecting youth offer any insights regarding how the educational force of the cul­
ture actually works pedagogically to reproduce dominant ideologies, values, iden­
tifications, and consent. I-low exactly is it possible to imagine a more just, more
equitable transformation in government and economics without a simultaneous
transformation in culture, consciousness, social identities, and values? Finally, it is
impossible to understand the current crisis of youth and democracy without situ­
ating such a crisis in a larger theoretical and historical context.
In addressing this challenge, it is important to provide a broader analysis of what
|48 | SECTION IIII BRUTALIZING YOUTH IN THE AGE OF ZOMBIE POLITICS
can be called the politics of free-market fundamentalism and disposability, exam­
ining it as an educational, cultural, and political discourse that has gutted the
notion ofthe social state and produced a set of policies that lay the groundwork for
a politics of greed and disposability that has had and continues to have dire conse­
quences for society at large, and especially for young people. As home foreclosures
reach into the millions, as more than fifteen million workers join the ranks of the
unemployed, as the ranks of the homeless expand beyond the wildest predictions,
children bear the brunt of these problems. As I have mentioned in previous chap­
ters, the notion of the child as symbol of adult responsibility and the hopeful future
once symbolized by the figure of the child are disappearing from American life.
Children now worry about how they can help their parents get ajob, make a mort­
gage payment, and simply afford to get food for a meal.
We now live in a country in which the pervasive and all-embracing reach of a
reactionary, racist, and greed-driven politics has reached its endpoint and reveals its
own arrogance and cruelty every day in the suffering of those individuals, children,
and families shipwrecked by the recklessness of a society that only believes in
short-term investments and the smell of fast profits. In response to this type of bar­
baric behavior and systemic misuse of power, the American public is further insult­
ed by a culture of cruelty that is offered up by right-wing media pundits as a form
of cheap theater. Fortunately, power is never completely on the side of domination,
nor is it entirely in the hands of those who view youth as an excess to be contained
or burden to be expelled. Power is also bom ofa realistic sense of hope, one that sit­
uates new possibilities and dreams of the future within the realities of current
structures of domination and oppression. Young people deserve more, and it is up
to those who are willing to assume a measure of civic courage and social responsi­
bility to come together and say enough is enough, and then mobilize to force
Obama to take seriously what it might mean to live up to the principles of both an
aspiring democracy and, yes, the Nobel Peace Prize. But more importantly, young
people and others need to develop social movements that create a political party that
refuses the center-right politics of the Democratic and Republican parties. This
would be a party that matches its ideals and rhetoric with action and policies that
benefit working- and middle-class people and not simply the elite running the
financial institutions; this would be a politics that provides universal health care,
expands social protections for the disadvantaged, and democraticizes wealth and
power in the United States so as to give real meaning to a democratic politics.
Zombie politics feeds off the lawlessness caused by massive inequalities in wealth,
income, and power. lt’s time to bury the dead and let the living once again inhab­
it the regions of government, the media, the economy, and other crucial spheres of
power.

Winter in America
Democracy Cone Rogue
The absolute. . .spells doom to everyone when it is introduced into the political realm.
HANNAH Aaeworl
emocracy in the United States is experiencing both a crisis of meaning and
a legitimation crisis. As the promise of an aspiring democracy is sacrificed
more and more to corporate and military interests, public spheres have largely been
commercialized, and democratic practices have been reduced to market relations,
stripped of their worth, and subject to the narrow logics of commodification and
profit-making. Empowerment has little to do with providing people with the
knowledge, skills, and power to shape the forces and institutions that bear down
on their lives and is now largely defined under the rubric of being a sawy consumer.
When not equated with free-market capitalism, democracy is reduced to the empty
rituals of elections largely shaped by corporate money and indifferent to relations
of power that make a mockery out of equality, democratic participation, and col­
lective deliberation.
The undoing of democracy as a substantive ideal is most visible in the illegal
legalities perpetuated by the Bush/Cheney regime and reproduced under the pres­
idency of Barack Obama that extend from the use of military commissions, the pol­
icy of indefinite detention, suppressing evidence of torture, maintaining secret and
illegal prisons in Afghanistan, to the refusal to prosecute former high-level govern­
ment officials who sanctioned acts of torture and other violations of human rights.

As part of the crisis of legitimation, democracy's undoing can be seen in the anti­
democratic nature of governance that has increasingly shaped domestic and foreign
policy in the United States, policies that have been well documented by a number
of writers extending from Noam Chomsky to Chris Hedges. What is often missed,
however, is how such anti-democratic forces work at home in ways that are less vis­
ible and-when they are visiblwseem to become easily normalized, removed from
any criticism as they settle into that ideological fog called common sense.
If the first rule of politics is to make power invisible, the second rule is to deval­
ue critical thought by relieving people of the necessity to think critically and hold
power accountable-always in the name of common sense. Under the populist rubric
of common sense, democracy is now used to invoke rationalizations for invading
other countries, bailing out the rich, and sanctioning the emergence of a national
security state that increasingly criminalizes the social relations and behaviors that
characterize those most excluded from what might be called the consumer and
celebrity-laden dreamworlds of a market-driven society As democracy is removed
from relations of equalityg justice, and freedom, it undergoes a legitimation crisis as
it is transformed from a mode of politics that subverts authoritarian tendencies to
one that reproduces them. Used to gift wrapping the interests and values of an
authoritarian culture, the rhetoric of democracy is now invoked to legitimate its
opposite, a discourse of security and a culture of fear enlisted by intellectuals, pun­
dits, and other anti-public intellectuals as all-embracing registers for mobilizing a
rampant nationalism, hatred of immigrants, and a bunker politics organized around
an “us-versus-them” mentality. When tied to the discourse of democracy, such
practices seem beyond criticism, part of a center-right mentality that views such poli­
cies as natural and God-given-beyond ethical and political reproach.
As the country undermines its own democratic values, violence and anti-demo­
cratic practices become institutionalized throughout American culture, their after­
shocks barely noticed, testifying to how commonplace they have become. For
instance, as one major report indicated recently more “than 60 percent of children
were exposed to violence within the past year . . . [with] nearly half of adolescents
surveyed _ . . assaulted at least once in the previous year [and] one-quarter had wit­
nessed an act of violence.”2 In just one week, the media reported on a 12-year-old
student who was arrested for doodling on her desk at school. Her teacher thought
it was a criminal act and called the New York City police who promptly handcuffed
her and took her to the local police station.3 In Montgomery, Maryland, a 13-year­
old student at Roberto Clemente Middle School was taken out of class by securi­
ty officers after she refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance! The mainstream
media provide glimpses of such assaults but rarely are they analyzed within a broad­
er political and social context that highlights the political and economic conditions
that make them possible. For instance, such assaults say nothing about the increas­
w|NTeR IN AMERICA | 155
ing militarization of public schools, the right-wing attempts to defund them so they
can be privatized, the rampant inequality that approximates a form of class warfare,
or the racism often at the heart of such practices.5
Such actions are now normalized within the discourse of an authoritarian pol­
itics fueled by both the increasing militarization of all levels of society and legiti­
mated further through a harsh and cruel notion of Economic Darwinism.There are
no shades of gray in this militarized discourse, no room for uncertainty, thought­
fulness, or dialogue, since this view of engagement is modeled on notions of war,
battle, winning at all costs, and eliminating the enemy. How this discourse plays out
in shaping public education is particularly revealing. Complex understanding is ban­
ished under the call for a thoughtless, one-size-fits-all, zero tolerance policy in
schools; intelligence is now quantified using formulas that may be uselill for mea­
suring the heights of trees but little else; and teachers are deskilled through the wide­
spread adoption of both a governing-through-crime pedagogy and an equally
debilitating pedagogy of high-stakes testing.
Resentment builds as social services either collapse or are stretched to the
limit at a time when over 15 million people are unemployed and over “91.6 million
people-more than 30 percent of the entire population-fell below 200 percent of
the federal poverty line.”6 Emerging out of this void and shaping a more militaris­
tic anti-politics are the anti-public intellectuals and their corporate sponsors, eager
to fill the air with populist anger by supporting right-wing groups, Sarah Palin types,
Glenn Beck clones, and self-styled patriots who bear an eerie resemblance to the
beliefs and violent politics of the late Timothy McVeigh, who bombed a federal
building in Oklahoma City in 1995.7
This emerging conglomerate and diverse group of anti-public intellectuals,
political pundits, and populist agitators express a deep-seated hatred for government
(often labeled as either socialist or fascist), progressive politics, and the notion that
everyone should have access to a quality education, decent health care, employment,
and other public services. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that Sarah
Palin, in addressing the recent National Tea Party convention, stated: “I will live, I
will die for the people of America, whatever I can do to help.”3 Surely, these words
leave little ambiguity for members of the _Iohn Birch Society, right-wing militia
groups, Oath Keepers white supremacists, and other armed anti-government groups
that appear to be growing in numbers and influence under the Obama presidency.
But while these lines received much attention from the dominant media, the more
telling comment took place when Palin offered the Tea Party audience lines she lift­
ed from one of the more fascistic films released by Hollywood in the last decade,
Fight Club. Inhabiting the character of a self-styled, pathologically violent maver­
ick, Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt), whose misogyny is matched by his will­
ingness to engage in acts of militia-inspired terrorism, Palin unabashedly mimics
156 | SECTION |v: CONCLUSION
one of Tyler’s now-famous wisecracks in attacking Obarna’s clever rhetoric with the
line, “How’s that hope); changey stuff working out for ya?”9 Going rogue in this con­
text suggests more than a compensatory quip for any kind of sustained analysis;
instead it offers a seductive populist reference to lawless violence.
This somewhat confused but reckless appropriation of the discourse of glam­
orized violence suggests the not-so-subtle ways in which violence has become the
framing mechanism for engaging in almost any mode of politics. Under such cir­
cumstances, politics shares an ignoble connection to a kind of soft terrorism, a kind
of symbolic violence blatantly tied to the pathologies of corporate cormption, state­
sanctioned brutality, and authoritarian modes of engagement. As violence and pol­
itics merge, the militarization, disciplining, and oppressive regulation of American
society continue, often legitimated by a popular culture in which the spectacles of
celebrity idiocy and violence become the only stimuli left to shock people out of their
boredom or offer them an outlet for their anger. But it continues in ways that seem
incidental rather than connected, diffused of its real meaning and abstracted from
the politics that informs it-hence, it slips into a kind of invisibility, wrapped in the
logic of common sense. Under its common sense rubric, homelessness and pover­
ty are now criminalized; schools are dominated by zero tolerance policies that turn
public schools into a low-intensity war zone; school lock-downs are the new fire
drills; the welfare state morphs into the warfare state, and university research is
increasingly funded by the military and designed for military and surveillance pur­
poses. In one of the more frightening examples of the militarization of American
society, David Price has brilliantly documented how government intelligence agen­
cies are now placing “unidentified students with undisclosed links to intelligence
agencies into university classrooms . . . and has gone further . . _ than any previous
intelligence initiative since World War Two. Yet, the program spreads with little pub­
lic notice, media coverage, or coordinated multicampus resistance."10
ls it any wonder that when intellectuals in the social sciences and medical fields
assist in the illegal torture of “enemy combatants” or embed themselves in military­
sponsored counter-insurgency campaigns, such practices rarely get the critical
attention they deserve? All too often, the blathering disciples of common sense tell
us that politics is rooted in natural laws, unhampered by critical thought-a kind
of plain folk wisdom. Such appeals to the alleged obvious suggest that thinking is
at odds with politics, and its hidden order of politics is hateful of those public spaces
where speaking and acting human beings actually engage in critical dialogue, exer­
cise discriminating judgments, and address important social problems. Common
sense is in effect an anti-politics because it removes questions of agency, governance,
and critical thought from politics itself
As part of the logic of plain speak, scapegoating rhetoric replaces the civic imag­
ination, and a brutalizing, calculating culture of fear, demonization, and criminal­
w|NTER IN AMER|cA | 157
ization replaces judgment, emptying politics of all substantive meaning. In this dis­
course, there are no social problems, only individual failings. Poverty, inadequate
health care, soaring public debt, the bailout of corrupt financial institutions, the
prison binge, and the destruction of public and higher education cannot be addressed
by the logic of common sense, because such issues point to broad, complex consid­
erations that demand a certain amount of understanding, literacy, and a sense of
political and moral responsibility-all enemies ofthe anti-public intellectuals who
wrap themselves in the populist appeal of a know-nothing common sense. The pop­
ulist appeal to the so-called obvious makes human beings superfluous, depoliticizes
politics, and transforms human beings into the living dead, unable to recognize “that
politics requires judgment, artful diplomacy, and judicious discrimination.”11
Common sense occupies the antithesis of Hannah Arendt’s insistence that debate
constitutes the very essence of political life.”12 This is the central message of the
zombie-like Fox News, Sean Hannity, and other right-wing {'i1nda.mentalists who
live in circles of certainty and reject any real attempt at debate, persuasion, and delib­
eration as the essence of politics. Their populist appeal to common sense to justi­
fy their various views of the world rejects both enlarged ways of thinking,
thoughtfulness, and the exercise of critical judgment. Such a discourse creates a zom­
bie politics in which deliberation is blocked and the ethos of democracy is stripped
of any meaning.
A zombie politics enmeshed in the production of organized violence, surveil­
lance, market-driven corruption, and control, buttressed by an appeal to common
sense, blocks the path to open inquiry. War not only becomes normalized under such
circumstances, it becomes a defining force in shaping all aspects of society, includ­
ing its use of science and technology. Put differently, as warlike values become more
prevalent in American society, science and technology are increasingly being har­
nessed in the interest of militarized and commercialized values and applications. For
example, the defense industries are developing drone aircraft that can be used to
deliver high-tech violence not only abroad but also at home. Unmanned drones, fit­
ted with surveillance cameras, will soon be used to monitor demonstrations. As the
technology becomes more advanced, the drones will be mounted with taser guns,
rubber bullets, and other non-lethal weaponry in order to contain allegedly unruly
individuals and crowds.13 High-tech weapons have already been used on American
protesters, and as the state relies more and more on military values, money, and influ­
ence to shape its most basic institutions, the use of organized violence against
civilians will become more commonplace. For instance, at the 2009 G20 summit
of world leaders, democracy took a hit as the Pittsburgh police used sonic cannons
against protestors.14 These high-tech weapons were used previously by the U.S. mil­
itary against Somali pirates and Iraqi insurgents and create sounds loud enough to
damage eardrums and potentially produce fatal aneurysms. In public schools, sur­
158 | SECTION uv: coNcLus|oN
veillance has become so widespread that one school in Rosemont, Pennsylvania,
issued over 1,800 laptops to high school students and then used the webcams fit­
ted on the computers to spy on them. The mainstream media hardly blinked, while
the public yawned.
Common sense may be good or bad in terms of its value, but in all cases it is
unreflective sense and as such short-cuts the types of critical inquiry fundamental
to an engaged public and an aspiring society. But it is particularly dangerous when
it becomes the pedagogical message of choice for much of the conservative-driven
media. Surely, common sense is of little help in explaining the existence of brain
research that is now being used to understand and influence how people respond
to diverse sales and political pitches. Nor does it explain why there is not a huge pub­
lic outcry over the emergence of a field such as neuromarketing, designed by politi­
cians and corporations who are “using MRIS, EEGS, and other brain-scan and
medical technology to craft irresistible media messages designed to shift buying
habits, political beliefs and voting patterns.”15 Nor does it explain the politics or the
lack of public resistance to food industries using the new media to market junk food
to children. Zombie politics loves to depoliticize any vestige of individual agency
and will. How else to explain a story by Ne-w York Times writer Nicholas D. Kristo£
that legitimates the notion that political judgments are primarily the result of how
our brains are hard wired. This is the ultimate expression of anti-politics in which
matters of agency are now removed from any sense of responsibility, relegated to the
brave new world of genetic determinism.
Under such circmnstances, memory is lost; history is erased; knowledge becomes
militarized, and education becomes more of a tool of domination than of empow­
erment. One result is not merely a collective ignorance over the meaning, nature,
and possibilities of politics but a disdain for democracy itselfthat provides the con­
dition for a lethal combination of political apathy and cynicism on the one hand and
a populist anger and an ethical hardening ofthe culture on the other. Symbolic and
real violence are now the defining features of American society. Instead of appeal­
ing to the principles of social justice, moral responsibility, and civic courage, the anti­
public intellectuals and the market-driven institutions that support them laud
common sense. What they don’t mention is that underlying such appeals is a hatred
not merely for govemment but for democracy itself The rage will continue and the
flirtations with violence will mount. Going rogue is now a metaphor for the death
of democratic values and support for modes of symbolic and potentially real vio­
lence in which all vestiges of thought, self-reflection, and dialogue are destroyed.
As I have pointed out throughout this book, while the presence of zombies
seems to dominate the news and the American political and cultural landscape, it
does not signal the end of democratic politics. In fact, the increasing presence of the
hyper-dead makes the need for resistance to such a politics all the more obvious,

especially regarding those public spheres and institutions that produce knowledge,
ideas, desires, and values crucial to an aspiring democracy. While the struggle for
reclaiming the government as a responsible social state capable of both placing lim­
its on capital and providing protections for all Americans has to be central to such
a challenge, so does the struggle over culture as a form of public pedagogy. The likes
of Beck, Limbaugh, and Palin matter not simply because of what they say, but
because of the emergence and influence of anti-democratic institutions and the for­
mations of capital that support them.
Power does not work simply through the control and influence of wealth,
income, and resources. lt also has to legitimate itself] and for that it needs to cre­
ate a pedagogical culture through which it can promote its ideologies and values.
Vast right-wing cultural apparatuses now exist in the mainstream media, on college
campuses, and in the government-a kind of stealth pedagogical machine that does
everything it can to promote its political agenda. The current fiasco in Texas and
Arizona speaks to the seriousness of such a struggle as ethnic studies are banned,
social studies curricula are rewritten so as to erase any vestige of progressive histo­
ry, and freedom is sabotaged as it is abstracted from politics and reduced to the prac­
tice of consumerism. Mythic history now combines with a notion of freedom that
is as reactionary as it is depoliticizing. Zombie politics thrives on a culture of blind­
ing illiteracy, and for such a culture to be challenged, labor, youth, unions, and other
groups must unite over the need to address at the very least two pressing and inter­
related issues.
Effective resistance to zombie politics first requires addressing the political, eco­
nomic, and cultural conditions of massive inequality produced by casino capitalism.
These conditions must be challenged in every sphere in which such injustices
appear. Such inequality is destructive of human lives and human societies, defines
matters of life and death-whose life is valued and whose life only counts as redun­
dant and disposable-and determines which members of society will have access to
vital resources and which ones won’t.16 This is demonstrated by the inequitable
funding of public schools and political campaigns, the poisonous influence of cor­
porate lobbyists in shaping legislation that benefits corporations and the rich,
access to quality health care based on wealth rather than need, and the massive cor­
rupt financial institutions that make a mockery of democracy while providing a
beachhead for expanding inequality in every aspect of our lives.
The second most pressing issue involves the educational force of political and
popular culture. Democratic ideas cannot exist without the public spheres that
make them possible. Culture in the form ofthe Intemet and mass media is the most
powerful influence now used by the hyper-dead to promote their zombie politics.
These spheres must be recovered. lntellectuals, parents, unions, workers, and other
concerned citizens need to reclaim those places that give the voiceless a voice,
160 | SEcT|oN uv: coNcLuS|oN
allow those marginalized by class and race to speak, and offer everyone the oppor­
tunity to reclaim an A.merica that currently oH`ers them little hope in terms of a bet­
ter and more just life. This not only means using altemative media to counter the
hate-mongers, the conservative foundations, and right-wing radio and television,
but also organizing in churches, synagogues, mosques, union halls, and public
schools in order to collectively reclaim such institutions as democratic public spheres
while gaining the experience needed to challenge zombie pedagogy in all of its man­
ifestations throughout the culture and society
Hannah Arendt has written that there are turning points in history when “the
decline of the old, the birth of the new, is not necessarily an affair of continuity.”
What emerges in this liminal space between generations, according to Arendt, is a
“kind of historical no man’s land” that can only be described in terms of “no longer
and not yet.”17 Today, we are living in one of these in-between times. The loom­
ing abyss is most obvious between the “no longer” of casino capitalism and the pol­
itics ofthe hyper-dead and the “not yet,” which holds the potential ofa new politics
to emerge and assert the imperatives of a democracy that values trust, compassion,
equality, freedom, and social justice. As Americans, we must choose now whether
to fall back into a pit of despair and death, ever widening to contain all but the
immensely rich and powerful, or to move forward as politicized individuals and
organized communities into a fixture rooted in and sustained by democratic prin­
ciples. The “not yet” of this presently unknown iilture demands of us that we con­
nect thoughtiiil critique and outrage to a notion of realizable hope and that we heed
a rallying cry for justice against a zombie politics in which democracy has been
reduced to a graveyard for the hyper-dead. Hopefully, the voices of reason and jus­
tice will recognize how serious this threat to democracy really is, and when they do,
they will surely understand what Gil Scott-Heron meant when he talked about win­
ter in America.
