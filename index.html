              <h2 class="post-title">No Longer the Greatest</h2>
              <h3 class="post-subtitle">
                There’s absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we’re the greatest 
                country in the world. We’re 7th in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th 
                in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, 3rd in median household income, 
                number 4 in labor force, and number 4 in exports.<br><br>
                We lead the world in only 3 categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, 
                number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend 
                more than the next 26 countries combined. 25 of whom are allies. 
                <br><br>
                The 'Greatest Generation' was followed by the absolute 'Worst Generation 
                in Human History'. So, when you ask, "what makes us the greatest country 
                in the world?" I don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about...Yosemite?<br>
                We sure used to be. We stood up for what was right. We fought for moral reasons. 
                We passed laws, struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty, 
                not poor people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors. We put our money 
                where our mouths were. And we never beat our chest. We built great big things, 
                made ungodly technological advances, explored the universe, cured diseases, 
                and we cultivated the world’s greatest artists and the world’s greatest economy. 
                We reached for the stars, acted like men. We aspired to intelligence, we didn’t 
                belittle it, it didn’t make us feel inferior. We didn’t identify ourselves by who 
                we voted for in our last election. And we didn’t… we didn’t scare so easy. 
                We were able to be all these things, and to do all these things, because 
                we were informed. By great men, men who were revered. First step in solving 
                any problem is recognizing there is one. America is not the greatest 
                country in the world anymore. Enough?

              <h3 class="post-subtitle">Got pulled over the Wednesday before Xmas, 2023.
                Let me set the scene. Driving home from doctor appointment, Wednesday morning
                approximately 9:30am. Fog gives visibility at 2 blocks. On a very narrow
                straightaway a motorcycle cop has someone pulled over. But both cop cycle
                and car are 2/3rd covering a lane. No area to pull over exists. So upon passing
                at approx 24mph, I put on my brakes. Car (ever so slightly) swirves. This is
                enough for the cop to give me a ticket for 500.00. Ass-hole?
                This, less than a week before Xmas. Also, the reason my car swirved was a flat
                tire. So I had to purchase a new tire for 150.00. Expensive day.<br/>
                Welcome to Monroe, Washington.

                I'm guessing the latter. Either that or humanity is truly a piece of shit.

                The Republican Party can lead any person to believe
                that their promises will be fulfilled in the future. They follow
                the fascist line - no matter how big the lie; repeat it often 
                enough and the masses will regard it as truth.<br>
                This country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor.<br>
                If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.

                  The muscular one, and bid him whip<br>
                  In kitchen cups concupiscent curds.<br>
                  Let the wenches dawdle in such dress<br>
                  As they are used to wear, and let the boys<br>
                  Bring flowers in last month's newspapers.<br>
                  Let be be finale of seem.<br>
                  The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.<br>
                  <br>
                  Take from the dresser of deal,<br>
                  Lacking the three glass knobs, that sheet<br>
                  On which she embroidered fantails once<br>
                  And spread it so as to cover her face.<br>
                  If her horny feet protrude, they come<br>
                  To show how cold she is, and dumb.<br>
                  Let the lamp affix its beam.<br>
                  The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.<br>
