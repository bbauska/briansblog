          <h2 class="chapter-title">Albert Einstein</h2>
          <p>Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later 
            the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium 
            (secondary school). Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, 
            Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained 
            as a teacher in physics and mathematics.</p>
          <p>In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable 
            to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office.</p>
          <p>In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree. Einstein’s researches are, of course, well chronicled and 
            his more important works include Special Theory of Relativity (1905), Relativity (English translations, 
            1920 and 1950), General Theory of Relativity (1916), Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement 
            (1926), and The Evolution of Physics (1938). Among his non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930), 
            Why War? (1933), My Philosophy (1934), and Out of My Later Years (1950) are perhaps the most important.</p>
          <p>In a recently unearthed recording of an interview conducted over 30 years ago, a former assistant to 
            Albert Einstein alleges that the famed scientist was enlisted to examine the Roswell wreckage, including 
            the ET occupants of the downed craft. UFO researcher Anthony Bragalia uncovered the remarkable revelation 
            when he tracked down ufologist Sheila Franklin, who interviewed Dr. Shirley Wright in 1993 about her time 
            working with Einstein in the summer of 1947. As luck would have it, Franklin still had the tapes from her 
            conversation with the former assistant and what she told the researcher was nothing short of stunning.</p>
          <p>According to Wright, she accompanied Einstein to what had been dubbed a "crisis conference" that was hastily 
            held in July of 1947 at a remote army airbase in the American southwest. Upon their arrival, the duo entered 
            a hangar that was under heavy security and, when they entered the building, they discovered that it contained 
            a rather curious craft that appeared to have sustained significant damage.</p>
          <p>"It was disc-shaped, sort of concave," Wright recalled, "its size stood up to one-fourth of the hangar floor."</p>
          <p>While her response to the strange scene was one of "wonderment, half curiosity and maybe half fear," she said 
            that Einstein was "not disturbed at all" and, instead, was primarily concerned with what sort of insights about 
            propulsion and the universe could be gleaned from the vehicle.</p>
          <p>The year of this Einstein quote (1952) is more than interesting. It is the same year that the Robertson Panel 
            (on which Einstein’s associate Goudsmit served) was planned. It was also the same year that mass UFO sightings 
            were occurring with frequency over Washington, DC. And it was the same year that Frank Edwards maintained Einstein 
            had warned the President about attacking the saucers.</p>
          <p>What is more interesting about the Einstein quote is what is not said. Though Einstein admits that there is reality 
            to the phenomena ("These people are seeing something"), he says that he does not want to know just what it is that 
            the people are seeing. This is of course disingenuous of Einstein. Since when does science shy away from encouraging 
            finding solutions to mysteries?</p>
          <p>Einstein’s own friend and associate Goudsmit certainly was interested in the phenomena during the same time period 
            Einstein was writing Gardner about it!</p>
          <p>It sounds more like Einstein simply does not wish to engage someone outside of his circle on this obviously sensitive 
            matter.</p>
          <dl>

            <dd>
              <em>noun</em><br>
              a mysterious object seen in the sky for which it is claimed no orthodox scientific explanation can be found, often 
              supposed to be a vehicle carrying extraterrestrials.
            </dd>
          </dl>
            <p>Another interpretation is that Einstein really did not want to know because he was afraid to know. And this 
              makes sense. If what Edwards says is true, Einstein feared the phenomenon.</p>
            <p>But what he feared more was us. Einstein feared our potential for a war-like reaction to the continued flyovers 
              of craft that were piloted by beings that were not from here and that were unknown to science.</p>

              <li>Header area with the title of the book on the left, and the author of said book on the right. <em>Erin is

            <p>She was then picturing herself making marks on a novel like she used to in school. In her true fashion, 
              she got carried away with "What ifs."</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"What if highlighting the text actually looked <mark>like a highlighter</mark>?"
                <ul>
                  <li>"What if I wanted it to be <mark class="pink">pink</mark>?"</li>
                  <li>"<mark class="blue">Blue</mark>?"</li>
                  <li>"<mark class="green">Green</mark>?"</li>
                  <li>"<mark class="orange">Orange</mark>?"</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>"What if I found <s>a typo</s><sup>an error in the content</sup> and wanted to make a correction?"</li>
              <li>"What if I was viewing this on mobile&mdash;"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The true obstacle showed its form. Responsiveness. How on Earth will she make this work?</p>
            <p>Erin pulled out her notepad and started sketching. First she began to illustrate the wireframe 
              of the book in its entirety. Then she recorded some notes on how each element would break down 
              as the screen size got smaller. After several minutes, the blueprint was complete. She came to 
              the conclusion that mobile viewing must stay minimal. The pages go away, which makes the page 
              numbers no longer have a function so they must go away, and if those go away then there is no 
              need for a cover since it is used to help hold and protect pages.</p>
            <p>She looks back at the blinking cursor of her blank canvas in Sublime Text 2. Doubt begins to 
              linger in the back of her mind with the thought of her new code never being used and her time 
              spent ends up being a waste. Her fingers were typing anyway.</p>
            <p>Erin smirked, "Well at least I think it's worth a try."</p>
