              Then, claim you will run for an unconstitional 3rd term as President<br>
              Tarriffs now?<br>
              Seriously?<br>
              No. He's a fucking idiot. A fucking idiot who respects only those with absolute power.<br>
              An idiot who flunked out in life. Failed businesses? Too many to count. Meme coins under
              his name &amp; Melania Trump's name is bribery directly from unknown sources.<br>
              Just tell them and show him they've made the bribe &amp; how much.<br>
              Beyond fucked. We are all fucked under the name of Trump.<br>
              Son in law, Kushner recieved upwards of a 100 billion dollars from Saudi & middle-east 
			  Fucks. Felony bribery? Russia's loans to Trump in the past 25 years? Felony bribery?
              They bailed out his failed businesses. All of them. When the banks in America
              would not touch him, they came to his rescue. For a big, big price to us all.<br>
              With Trump's election, your children &amp; children all over the world now realize 
			  they can be liars, deutsche-bags, and creaps. You see, if the President of United 
			  States can get away with it, than anyone can. Including the next generation. We (the 
			  US anyway) are screwed. Not much different than how the CIA has been acting since 
			  Ronald Reagan particularly, and since they murdered JF Kennedy specifically.<br>

              I've been a lazy writer my entire life. You know, since I could write. So, for the 
			  past 55 years. I remember not knowing how to spell icky. Spelling was always an anal 
			  passion for me. But for a procrastinator its a death knell. Anyhow, I always needed 
			  a pretty fair reason to continue writing. Rarely did I find it. Therefore, all of my 
			  ideas die with me. I'm an introvert so programming hit home. Rarely did I need to 
			  interface with people. It made the task much more difficult. But still attainable. 
			  thank you.<br>
              When shy, you assume rather than ask. Rarely works out. Costing twice or more in time 
			  and money.

              In the era of Chief Justice Roberts, the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed

              interests in dozens of cases, like Citizens United v. FEC, Shelby County 
              v. Holder, and Janus v. AFCSME. Have the conservative justices on the Court 
              been effectively “captured” by these corporate and right-wing interests? If 
              so, what role has the nominations process played and what can be done to 
              reverse this trend and ensure the Court serves only the interest of 
              impartiality, objectivity, and the rule of law?
