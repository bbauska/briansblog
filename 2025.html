		Now attack higher education, law firms, Panama Canal, Greenland, Canada, etc.<br>
		Then, claim you will run for an unconstitional 3rd term as President<br>
		Tarriffs now?<br>
		Seriously?<br>
		No. He's a fucking idiot. A fucking idiot who respects only those with absolute power.<br>
		An idiot who flunked out in life. Failed businesses? Too many to count. Meme coins under
		his name &amp; Melania Trump's name is bribery directly from unknown sources.<br>
		Just tell them and show him they've made the bribe &amp; how much.<br>
		Beyond fucked. We are all fucked under the name of Drumpf.<br>
		Son in law, Kushner recieved upwards of a trillion dollars from Saudi Fucks.
		Felony bribery? Russia's loans to Drumpf in the past 25 years? Felony bribery?
		They bailed out his failed businesses. All of them. When the banks in America
		would not touch him, they came to his rescue. For a big, big price to us all.<br>
		With Trump's election, your children &amp; children
                all over the world now realize they can be liars, deutsche-bags,
                and creaps. You see, if the President of United States can get
                away with it, than anyone can. Including the next generation.
                We (the US anyway) are screwed. Not much different than how the
                CIA has been acting since Ronald Reagan specifically, and since
                they murdered JF Kennedy specifically.<br>

                I've been a lazy writer my entire life. You know, since I could write. So, for the past 55 years. I remember not knowing how 
		to spell icky. Spelling was always an anal passion for me. But for a procrastinator its a death knell. 
		Anyhow, I always needed a pretty fair reason to continue writing. Rarely did I find it. Therefore, all of my ideas die with me.
		I'm an introvert so programming hit home. Rarely did I need to interface with people. It made the task much more difficult. But
		still attainable. thank you.<br>
		When shy, you assume rather than ask. Rarely works out. Costing twice or more in time and money.

                Can we talk about the F*ckin' Morons at the NY

                According to the NY Times, all of the crop circles
                WORLDWIDE were made by TWO people &amp; copy-cats!
                Stating these two men (old & dead now) created
                over 100,000 perfect concentric crop circles
                &amp; pictograms...sometimes over an acre in size.
                And they did this for 40+ years.
                All around the World.
                This, according to the WA Post &amp; NY Times.
                These organizations are either moronic idiots
                and the dumbest mother-f**kers on planet Earth.
                OR they are on the take.
                NOBODY is that stupid. Nobody!...

                Flying Saucers if you may. They won't even report on them.
                1,000's of sightings Worldwide every
                month. Over 100,000 documented since 1947.
                That is a true scientific mystery.
                Wouldn't even know it if you trust

                In the era of Chief Justice Roberts, the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed 
                justices have delivered landmark victories for corporate and right-wing 
                interests in dozens of cases, like Citizens United v. FEC, Shelby County 
                v. Holder, and Janus v. AFCSME. Have the conservative justices on the Court 
                been effectively “captured” by these corporate and right-wing interests? If 
                so, what role has the nominations process played and what can be done to 
                reverse this trend and ensure the Court serves only the interest of 
                impartiality, objectivity, and the rule of law?

              <h3 class="post-subtitle">Many say exploration is part of our destiny, 
                but it’s actually our duty to future generations.
                Yet, NASA lies to its benefactors,
                Lies to the American people,
                Lies to the US Congress,
                Lies to the Ef'n World.
                NASA is a joke.
                Close these LIARS down!
                Defund these pricks!</h3>

                Seems more than 1/2 the scientists and 75% of the
