So now it's the very companies out for the little guy who are in fact fucking the little guy the hardest.  Without their consent mind you.  Coinbase is a pathetic hunk of greedy cocksuckers.  And not the
cocksuckers who fondle your balls.  These are ones who bite.  And bite hard.  Then they kick you in the balls.  Motherfuckers, one and all.  They will charge 75 cents to make a purchase or sale of a crypto
if the sale is 1 million dollars.  But they will charge me 5.00 to trade $50.00.  What the fuck?

This is just one of the worst.  Not unique.  All large companies are evil.  They all do more harm than good.  Monopolies are un-American.  Yet very "American".

Aug 10, 2023.  My humble opinion.  What power goes money?  Unfortunately, almost all.  Which portends the Human race in lowercase.  Quite literally, humans suck.  When we are pressed, we bite rather than reach out.  Fear everything we don't know.  Kill most things we do know.  We pray to money, gold in particular.  Now it's gotten to the point where the fucking 'haves' don't give flying fuck about everyone else.  Fuck them and the security state in America.  The US is hiding technology which could transform the World.  Selfishly.  Like that Van Der fuck back in the 1950's who knew UFO's were extra terrestrial but lied about it when asked.  Project just before project bluebook.  2 year study and he burned it.  Fuck you Van Der Dickhead.

Today, a war in Ukraine rages on. Putin to blame.  Yet, the West as well gets 1/3rd because we could have nipped this in the bud and chose not to.  Chose.  Just like choosing not to resolve the Chinese issues.  Discussions are for the poor.  The rich use their money to do their talking.  And fuck all them.  Every fucking one of them.  Fuck em.

The war in Ukraine wasn't enough.  Now we have a Palistine and Israel war.  Hamas.  It is such a round of bullshit.  Religion and the assholes who will kill for it.  Not money, now.  It's 'belief'.  That gets to the center of human kind. So, now, the assholes are acting like Catholics did a thousand years ago.  Only they have the answers because they are the undisputed champions of knowledge and power.  Well, fuck you!

Now, let's talk about Washington Post (idiot cavemen and women).  The military industrial complex (mic) with their boney and grubby money hungry fingers. Never having enough.  Stealing, killing, lying.  No bottom to how low these fucks will go. Taking my tax dollars than lie, lie, lie.  Fucking the American people without asking.  Mother-fuckers one and all.

They (the MIC) have advanced knowledge and they are suppressing it.  Thinking they know best.  WTF?  Started out to 'protect us'.  Fuck you!  It's now all about energy.  Big oil, coal, and nuclear.  If these were erradicated with low or even no-cost energy, they World could save millions of lives and actually advance human kind.  But these rich fucks decided with the military to stop advancements of energy development.  No science would be funded for 80+ years.

Now, let's talk about the cocksucking NY Times.  Ya, arrogant mother-fuckers.  How about those idiots with the military?  Always looking for a nail with their big fucking hammers.  All over the World.  Picking fights to show off their tools from the far future.

Using military logic, United States (and the World) may be only as smart as the dumbest American (or human for that matter). What the Fuck?  I fucking despise the military for that logic.  They have none.  No legitimate scientist could actually advance humanity in America using the military guidance.  Which is the only way science can advance because they had ALL the money for research.  It's fucking mind-boggling.  Now with some-what free internet sharing and liberty, we can leap-frog over these deutsch-bags and show them they don't own the World.  So a giant middle-finger to the MIC.

No more lies.  So what does the MIC do?  They flood the internet with so many lies no one can find the truth.  They're final stand at battling intelligence for the benefit of a few.  A very, very few.  Perhaps a couple thousand compared to 7.5 billion.  Despicable.

Now, let's discuss Edward Condon.  An ass-hole wanna-be scientist who thought he was the smartest man in the fucking Universe.  What an asshole.  A third-degree Colorado deutsche-bag who lied with Loe and told the World just what the Air Force told them.  What kind of science is that?  Air Force possesses no knowledge.  Period.  Therefore, we are idiots.
