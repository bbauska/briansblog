                Can we talk about the F*ckin' Morons at the NY
                Times &amp; WA Post?
                According to the NY Times, all of the crop circles
                WORLDWIDE were made by TWO people &amp; copy-cats!
                Stating these two men (old & dead now) created
                over 100,000 perfect concentric crop circles
                &amp; pictograms...sometimes over an acre in size.
                And they did this for 40+ years.
                All around the World.
                This, according to the WA Post &amp; NY Times.
                These organizations are either moronic idiots
                and the dumbest mother-f**kers on planet Earth.
                OR they are on the take.
                NOBODY is that stupid. Nobody!...
                So, FOAD - New York Times...And don't forget to 'D'!
                &amp; FOAD - Washington Post...And don't forget to 'D'!
                You 2 make me sick.  Communism is no worse than
                your disinformation. Your outright lies!
                And what about UAP's? You know, UFO's?
                Flying Saucers if you may. They won't even report on them.
                1,000's of sightings Worldwide every
                month. Over 100,000 documented since 1947.
                That is a true scientific mystery.
                Wouldn't even know it if you trust
                either of these 'news'papers.</h3>

              <h3 class="post-subtitle">
                In the era of Chief Justice Roberts, the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed 
                justices have delivered landmark victories for corporate and right-wing 
                interests in dozens of cases, like Citizens United v. FEC, Shelby County 
                v. Holder, and Janus v. AFCSME. Have the conservative justices on the Court 
                been effectively “captured” by these corporate and right-wing interests? If 
                so, what role has the nominations process played and what can be done to 
                reverse this trend and ensure the Court serves only the interest of 
                impartiality, objectivity, and the rule of law?

              <h3 class="post-subtitle">The view of the earth from the moon fascinated me - a small disk, 
                240,000 mniles away. It was hard to think that that little thing held so many problems, so 
                many frustrations. Raging nationalistic interests, famines, wars, pestilence don't show 
                from that distance. I'm convinced that some wayward stranger in a space-craft, coming from 
                some other part of the heavens, could look at earth and never know that it was inhabited at 
                all. But the same wayward stranger would certainly know instinctively that if the earth were 
                inhabited, then the destinies of all who lived on it must inevitably be interwoven and joined. 
                We are one hunk of ground, water, air, clouds, floating around in space. From out there it 
                really is 'one world'.
